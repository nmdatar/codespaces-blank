707,"Imposing travel restrictions for China arrivals ""scientifically unjustified"": ACI EUROPE","   PARIS, Jan. 2 (Xinhua) -- The systematic pre-departure or on-arrival testing of travelers from China for COVID-19 is ""neither scientifically justified nor risk-based,"" the Europe branch of Airports Council International (ACI EUROPE) said recently. In a press release on Dec. 31, 2022, the organization expressed its ""regret regarding the actions of a number of states within the EU (European Union) and globally for unilaterally imposing health-related travel requirements."" ""These unilateral actions are at odds with all the experience and evidence gained over the past three years,"" it said, adding that ""these travel restrictions do not work.""   The ineffectiveness of international travel restrictions in preventing the spread of COVID-19 and its multiple variants of concern (VOCs) has been unequivocally recognized by both the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), ACI EUROPE noted. According to the organization, as states need to remain vigilant to the status and control of the virus, the focus should instead be on increasing genomic sequencing to identify possible new COVID-19 variants and related surveillance.   ""Such an approach, as urged by EU Health Commissioner (Stella) Kyriakides in a letter sent earlier this week to the member states, does not require the testing of travelers, but can be achieved by means such as the testing of wastewater from airports,"" the ACI EUROPE press release said. ""We are once again plunging back into a patchwork of unjustified and uncoordinated travel restrictions, which have no basis in scientific fact,"" commented Olivier Jankovec, director general of ACI EUROPE.",Xinhua,2023-01-03 08:53

716,U.S. logs record number of discrimination complaints from schools,"   NEW YORK, Jan. 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Education Department's Office for Civil Rights logged a record nearly 19,000 discrimination complaints in the last fiscal year from Oct. 1, 2021 to Sept. 30, 2022. The number is more than double the previous year's and breaks the record of 16,000 filed in fiscal year 2016, reported the New York Times on Sunday. ""The latest indicator of how the social and political strife roiling the country is reverberating in the nation's schools,"" the newspaper said, noting that the surge reversed the decline in complaints filed to the office under the Trump administration. Officials say the complaints -- most alleging discrimination based on disability, race or sex -- reflect grievances that amassed during the worst public health crisis in a century and the most divisive civil rights climate in decades, according to the report. ""The complaints were logged as schools struggled to recover from pandemic-related closures, and add to the declining test scores and growing mental health challenges that display the fragility in large parts of the country's education system,"" it said. ""It reflects the confidence in the Office for Civil Rights as a place to seek redress ... At the same time, the scope and volume of harm that we're asking our babies to navigate is astronomical,"" the report quoted Catherine Lhamon, assistant secretary for civil rights, as saying.",Xinhua,2023-01-03 10:30
690,Sweden sees highest number of bankruptcy filings since 2013,"  STOCKHOLM, Jan. 2 (Xinhua) -- Due mainly to the ongoing Ukraine crisis, the accelerating rate of inflation and high electricity prices, the number of bankruptcies in Sweden rose to the highest level in a decade during the second half of 2022, according to statistics released on Monday. Between July and December 2022, 22 percent more bankruptcies were registered than in the same period in 2021, business and credit reference agency UC said in a press release. According to UC, nearly 3,500 companies filed for bankruptcy in the said period, around 300 more than in the same period in 2013, when the previous record was registered. In December alone, UC said that the number of bankruptcies increased by 17 percent year-on-year. Among hotels and restaurants, the number of bankruptcies was 29 percent higher in December than in the same month in 2021. The respective increase among retailers was 28 percent, UC said. Meanwhile, the total number of start-ups across all sectors decreased by 13 percent in December compared with the same month in 2021, UC said.   As Sweden eased the COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions, 2021 saw the lowest number of bankruptcies on record. The year 2022 also started on a high note, but concluded with unpleasant surprises, UC economist Johanna Blome said in the press release. ""Ahead of 2022, optimism was high, not least as a result of the record low number of bankruptcies in the past year and the removal of pandemic restrictions. A bright future was predicted for Sweden's entrepreneurs and small business owners, but unfortunately, the year (2022) instead offered a series of unpleasant surprises that affected both the Swedish and the global economy,"" Blome said. ""Many companies face a tough 2023. Smaller companies can suffer from setbacks in liquidity as a result of increased electricity and purchase costs as well as interests,"" Blome said, adding, ""The risk is great that bankruptcies will continue to increase and the number of start-ups will decrease -- at least during the first part of 2023."" In the week leading up to the 2022 year-end holidays, the Swedish government said that the country was entering a recession that was expected to last until 2025. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to shrink by 0.7 percent this year. Unemployment is expected to grow to 7.8 percent in 2023 and to 8.2 percent in 2024.",Xinhua,2023-01-03 13:08

""The leitmotif of becoming more independent of China is deeply embedded in both American parties,"" said the article released on Nov. 25. This is why the United States was putting billions in subsidies and investments that favor domestic manufacturers, it added. To isolate China, the United States was also ""embracing conflict with its key allies,"" according to the op-ed.

692,Scandal over U.S. congressman-elect lying about resume snowballs,"   WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- A scandal over U.S. Congressman-elect George Santos lying about his resume has been snowballing, casting a bleak shadow over Washington ahead of the sworn-in of a new and divided Congress. Santos, elected in the 2022 midterm elections to represent New York's 3rd congressional district, admitted to The New York Post last week that he had lied about his work experience and education on the campaign trail. ""My sins here are embellishing my resume. I'm sorry,"" said Santos, a 34-year-old Republican, alleging that the controversy will not deter him ""from having good legislative success.""  Santos billed himself as the ""full embodiment of the American dream"" -- an openly gay son of Brazilian immigrants who becomes a ""seasoned Wall Street financier and investor"" with experience working in the business world. Santos boasted he had worked for high-profile Wall Street firms Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, but neither company could find any records verifying his claims, according to an investigation by The New York Times. In February 2021, Santos tweeted he and his family owned more than a dozen properties, while tenants did not pay their rent for nearly a year. However, no evidence has been uncovered verifying such claims of property ownership. Furthermore, he claimed to have received a degree from Baruch College, a public college in New York City, in 2010, which also turned out to be a lie. Officials at the institution, The New York Times reported, ""could find no record of anyone matching his name and date of birth graduating that year."" In his confession to The New York Post, Santos acknowledged he had ""never worked directly"" for either Citigroup or Goldman Sachs, arguing that it was a ""poor choice of words"" to say he worked for the companies while revealing that he ""does not own any properties"" and ""didn't graduate from any institution of higher learning."" Santos also clarified he is ""clearly Catholic"" after describing himself as a nonobservant Jew. As to sexual orientation, he confirmed to The New York Post that he was married to a woman for about five years but insisted that he is now a happily married gay man.    Former U.S. Congresswoman from Hawaii and Fox News contributor Tulsi Gabbard ripped Santos to shreds while interviewing the congressman-elect last week, asking him, ""do you have no shame?"" ""If I were one of those in New York's 3rd district right now, now that the election is over, and I'm finding out all of these lies that you've told, not just one little lie or one little embellishment,"" Gabbard told Santos. ""These are blatant lies."" Santos responded by underlining that he has ""the courage"" to admit and face his mistakes and that ""I want to put this past me, so I can deliver for the American people."" ""I understand. Everybody wants to nitpick at me,"" he complained. ""I'm going to reassure this once and for all -- I'm not a facade. I'm not a persona. I have an extensive career that I worked real hard to achieve."" The Fox News guest host added, ""It's hard to imagine how they could possibly trust your explanations when you're not really even willing to admit the depth of your deception to them.""  It is not rare that U.S. politicians tell lies about their life stories and policy proposals to court support. U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, re-elected to a third term last year, built his political prominence by portraying his parents as exiles from their native Cuba. But a review of The Washington Post published in 2011 wrote that the Republican's account ""embellishes the facts"" and that ""the real story of his parents' migration appears to be a more conventional immigrant narrative."" Herschel Walker campaigned against abortion access in 2022 as the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Georgia. However, his former girlfriends have accused him of encouraging or paying for abortion. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat who ran for the White House several years ago, issued a public apology in 2019 for her past claims of Native American ancestry. ""Permanent Washington has created a culture where it's acceptable to lie to further your own interest. Just try not to get caught,"" Gabbard, who left the Democrat to become an independent last year, commented. ""But even when politicians do get caught, people just shrug their shoulders and move on. No big deal, no consequences."" ""So, no one should be surprised that the American people don't trust these politicians. They've got no faith that those in Washington are actually working for the people when they're so clearly working for themselves,"" she pointed out. Public trust in the U.S. Congress reached an all-time low, with only 7 percent of Americans expressing ""a great deal"" or ""quite a lot"" of confidence in it, according to a Gallup poll released in the summer of 2022.    Republicans flipped the House of Representatives in last year's midterm elections while Democrats held onto their majority in the Senate. The divided Congress will be sworn in on Tuesday, with Santos to join the ranks and files of American lawmakers despite bipartisan calls for him not to take office. According to U.S. legal pundits, the House can only prevent candidates from taking office if they violate the Constitution's age, citizenship and state residency requirements. But Santos may face ethics investigations after he's seated. Federal prosecutors in New York have opened an investigation into Santos, which is in its early stages and has not yet zeroed in on any one allegation of wrongdoing. Prosecutors are reportedly examining Santos' finances, including potential irregularities involving financial disclosures and loans he made to his campaign as he was running for representing New York's 3rd congressional district, which covers part of the North Shore of Long Island and northeastern Queens. Jeff Mayhugh, a former candidate for Virginia's 10th congressional district, authored an article published by Newsweek last week, writing that ""Santos's lies exposed a much deeper rot in our political system."" ""He is a symptom of a much bigger problem than just his own dishonesty,"" Mayhugh continued, calling out ""a broken political system that focuses too much on profit and control and too little on serving the people.""",Xinhua,2023-01-03 15:34
693,U.S. sanctions deprive Iranians of breathing fresh air under severe pollution: experts,"TEHRAN, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- With the arrival of the cold season, the air pollution in Iran's capital Tehran has reached an alarming level and is hazardous for the health of local residents. Domestic and foreign experts pointed out that under the years-long U.S. sanctions, the forced use of old vehicles, which should have been scrapped long ago, is the cause of the terrible air quality in Tehran.  Over the past weeks, Tehran's local authorities decided to shut down school and university classes for some days and switched to online learning. Abed Maleki, deputy director of Civil Affairs Coordination of Tehran Governorate, announced on Monday the continuation of remote working of sensitive groups of employees, including pregnant women, employees aging above 50, and those who have heart, lung, respiratory and rheumatic diseases as well as ones with diabetes, high blood pressure and cancer problems, according to official IRNA news agency. Maleki said that based on the approvals of the air pollution emergency working group, universities and all educational levels of Tehran will continue online learning for two more days until Wednesday, while sports activities in open spaces are also canceled. The even-and-odd plans for motorists are implemented as traffic rationing measures under which private vehicles with registration numbers ending with an odd digit will be allowed on the streets on odd dates and those with an even digit on even dates. Besides, a daily permit license to enter the restricted traffic zones in Tehran will not be issued by Tehran Municipality until Wednesday, Maleki said, urging the citizens to refrain from unnecessary activities outdoors.  Abbas Shahsavandi, the head of the air health and climate change department of Iran's Health Ministry, pointed out that the traffic of old cars and diesel motorcycles is the main reason behind Tehran's air pollution. There are many clunker vehicles and diesel motorcycles in Tehran, which must be removed from the consumption cycle, Shahsavandi was quoted as saying by Tehran Times. Also, Abdollah Motevalli, deputy director of Iran's Standards and Quality Inspection Company, said that some 83 percent of air pollution in Tehran and 70 percent in other Iranian big cities are caused by vehicles, according to the report. On Dec. 20, 2022, a group of UN human rights experts announced that ""it is no surprise that Tehran is one of the world's most polluted cities. U.S. sanctions force people to prolong the use of older vehicles that burn fuel less efficiently, while making it impossible for Iran to obtain equipment and technology to reduce vehicle emissions."" The sanctions also prevent Iranian scientists from engaging in joint environmental research projects abroad, and prevent Iranians from accessing online databases and courses about environmental issues and sustainability, they pointed out.  On Monday, Mojtaba Shafiee, managing director of the Transport and Traffic Organization of Tehran Municipality, stressed that new ideas are needed to tackle the traffic and air pollution in Tehran. Elaborating on the effect of the even-and-odd plan from the door of the homes on reducing air pollution, he noted that if the plan is implemented correctly, it will be effective in reducing air pollution. He also announced the holding of the 19th International Conference on Transportation and Traffic Engineering in Tehran in March, with its focus on public and smart transportation among other topics. Regarding the development of cycling routes in the capital, he stated that the use of shared bicycles is one of the main models of traffic management around the world that should be considered in Tehran. In the meantime, Motevalli said that all motor vehicles used by government, public and non-government sectors are required to obtain a technical examination certificate, which can be highly effective in reducing air pollution, optimizing fuel consumption and car safety, and consequently the health of citizens.",Xinhua,2023-01-03 16:33

U.S. Congressman Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, lost the second ballot for House speaker after 19 Republicans again voted against him. A third vote is underway, a scenario that hasn't been seen in a century. A candidate needs 218 votes to become House speaker if no member skips the vote or votes ""present."" ""We stay in until we win,"" McCarthy told reporters, adding that the numbers ""will change eventually."" The political drama came nearly two months after the 2022 midterm elections, in which Republicans flipped the House and Democrats held onto their majority in the Senate, and shortly after the divided Congress convened Tuesday noon. All House Democrats have voted for Congressman Hakeem Jeffries from New York to lead the Democratic minority in the first two ballots. Jemele Hill, a contributing writer for The Atlantic, tweeted on Tuesday afternoon that ""what we're witnessing today in American politics is just another brutal indictment of this dysfunctional political system."" If no candidate wins a majority of votes in the third round, House members will vote on and on until a speaker is elected. House members can adjourn to negotiate but the lower chamber does not kick off the new term until the speaker election is over. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Tuesday afternoon that U.S. President Joe Biden, a former six-term senator, ""will not insert himself in that process."" ""The president served as a U.S. senator for 34 years and he understands how this process works,"" Jean-Pierre said. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris presided over the opening day of the Senate, where Democrats have a slim 51-49 majority over Republicans, when she swore in 35 either newly elected or reelected senators Tuesday afternoon. Chuck Schumer from New York and Mitch McConnell from Kentucky, both Senate veterans, will continue to serve as the chamber's majority leader and minority leader, respectively. Public trust in the U.S. Congress reached an all-time low, with only 7 percent of Americans expressing ""a great deal"" or ""quite a lot"" of confidence in it, according to a Gallup poll released in the summer of 2022.

694,"Fuss over China's coronavirus situation unwarranted, says Cyprus virologist","NICOSIA, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- Worry and panic over reports about a surge of coronavirus cases in China are excessive and unwarranted, a leading Cypriot virologist said here on Tuesday. ""So far, there is no particular cause for concern because the COVID-19 variant that prevails in China was detected in Cyprus months ago and it doesn't seem to pose much of a problem,"" Petros Karayiannis, professor of microbiology and molecular virology at the University of Nicosia Medical School, said. Karayiannis is a member of the scientific team advising the government on the handling of the pandemic. ""Because it concerns Omicron variants, I believe that perhaps it was somewhat excessive that there was such a fuss,"" Karayiannis told the CyBC state radio. He said that the Omicron subvariant BF.7, a spin-off of the main BA.5 strain, is thought to be responsible for a small percentage of COVID-19 cases in Cyprus and it has not been found to cause more severe symptoms than the other Omicron variants. Karayiannis said that in his view the virus mutates to increase its transmissibility and to survive, but in doing so it does not become more pestiferous. According to Karayiannis, the current situation in Cyprus is not causing a concern to medical authorities as new COVID-19 cases have stabilized at about 2,700 per week in a population of less than one million.",Xinhua,2023-01-04 10:19
695,5 countries start responsibilities as newly elected members of UN Security Council,"  UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- Five countries -- Ecuador, Japan, Malta, Mozambique and Switzerland -- on Tuesday began to assume responsibilities as non-permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. Their two-year term officially started on Jan. 1, but the first business day of the Security Council for 2023 after the New Year holiday break is Tuesday, Jan. 3. A flag installation ceremony was held to mark the start of their responsibilities. The ceremony was initiated by Kazakhstan in 2018. Kazakhstan's permanent representative Akan Rakhmetullin, who presided over the ceremony, voiced confidence that the five new council members will bring much depth and focus to the pressing issues of global peace and security. ""As we begin a new year, it is clear that the global situation continues to be marked by numerous challenges and crisis, from ongoing conflicts and humanitarian calamities to the negative impacts of climate change and the pandemic,"" Rakhmetullin said.   Addressing these acute issues requires cooperation and solidarity as well as the commitment of all UN member states, he said. The permanent representatives of the five new council members made short speeches before they installed their respective national flags outside the Security Council Chamber. The five countries replaced India, Ireland, Kenya, Mexico and Norway. The 15-member Security Council has five permanent members -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States, and 10 non-permanent members elected for two-year terms by the UN General Assembly. Five non-permanent members are replaced every year. Albania, Brazil, Gabon, Ghana and the United Arab Emirates are in the middle of their two-year term as non-permanent members.",Xinhua,2023-01-04 10:21

The session came nearly two months after the 2022 midterm elections, in which Republicans flipped the U.S. House of Representatives and Democrats held onto their majority in the Senate. U.S. Congressman Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, lost an initial vote for House speaker on Tuesday afternoon after 19 Republicans voted for others, sending the election to a second ballot. All House Democrats voted for Congressman Hakeem Jeffries from New York to lead the Democratic minority, set to make him the first African American lawmaker to lead a party in either chamber of the U.S. Congress. If no candidate wins a majority of votes in the next round, House members will vote on and on until a speaker is elected. U.S. Congressman-elect George Santos, a 34-year-old Republican from New York, is among those who are waiting to be sworn in after the speaker vote. Santos has recently admitted to lying about his educational history and professional biography but rejected bipartisan calls for him not to take office. ""My sins here are embellishing my resume. I'm sorry,"" embattled Santos acknowledged last week while alleging that the controversy would not deter him ""from having good legislative success."" Former U.S. Congresswoman and Fox News contributor Tulsi Gabbard commented, ""Washington has created a culture where it's acceptable to lie to further your own interest.""

698,Iraqi protesters blast U.S. for violating sovereignty on 3rd anniversary of deadly drone strike,"BAGHDAD, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraqis on Tuesday rallied to mark the third anniversary of the assassination of two Iraqi and Iranian commanders in a U.S. drone attack, condemning the U.S. terror act and its violation of Iraqi sovereignty. On the al-Tahrir Square in the capital Baghdad, scores of Iraqis held high the pictures of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy chief of Iraq's paramilitary Hashd Shaabi forces, and Qassem Soleimani, former commander of the Quds Force of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC). Both Soleimani and al-Muhandis, who played important roles in the war against the extremist Islamic State (IS) militants, were assassinated in the U.S. drone attack on a convoy of vehicles near the Baghdad International Airport on Jan. 3, 2020. The Iraqi protesters denounced the United States for creating chaos or disasters in Iraq, which was invaded by the U.S. forces in 2003, and even all over the world in the name of ""protecting human rights."" ""They (Americans) target a leader inside our country. (Therefore) there is no sovereignty. Not even the airspace belongs to Iraq. They (U.S. aircraft) enter our airspace and strike our leaders,"" Ahmed Kadhim, a fitness trainer, told Xinhua. He said the airstrike was a flagrant violation of Iraq's sovereignty, stressing that the United States is an ""undemocratic and inhumane country"". ""America is the creator of terrorism, and it is the country of chaos and wants to spread chaos all over the world,"" Kadhim added. Sadid Abdul-Ghani, a retired government employee, told Xinhua that the illegal airstrike that assassinated Soleimani and al-Muhandis was a flagrant violation of Iraq's sovereignty, Iraqis' human rights and all international laws. ""This is a painful terrorist act ... It violates human rights in this airstrike and in other acts"" that spread terrorism in Iraq and other countries, Abdul-Ghani said. He said the United States has been bringing about chaos, internal fight, instability and economic crisis to Iraq and other countries. ""By this airstrike, the United States aimed to dominate Iraq and the region and to control the world,"" he added. Ahmed Salim, a Baghdad resident, condemned the U.S. airstrike that killed Soleimani and al-Muhandis, saying Washington ""wanted to dominate Iraq."" ""It claims that it fights terrorism, but it committed a terrorist crime at dawn on Jan. 3, 2020,"" he said. Also on Tuesday, the Iraqi Hashd Shaabi held a memorial service at the site of the airstrike on a road near the Baghdad International Airport, which was attended by many Iraqis. ""The enemies were disappointed, as they thought that by making people absent and killing leaders, the will of nations would be broken, but they missed that the martyrs are the makers of the glory of every nation,"" Falih al-Fayyadh, head of the Hashd Shaabi commission, said in a speech. ""The assassination of the two leaders, al-Muhandis and Soleimani, was orchestrated by (former U.S. President Donald) Trump, but it will not be long before we see him in the dustbin of history,"" al-Fayyadh added. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' al-Sudani said in a tweet that ""it is necessary to recall the leaders of victory and their heroism in confronting the most violent extremist terrorist group (IS) known to our contemporary history."" He said the assassination of the two leaders motivated the Iraqi government to work to ""consolidate sovereignty and work for an Iraq that is independent in its policies and capable of protecting its people."" The U.S. airstrike that killed Soleimani and al-Muhandis sparked tension and reprisal attacks between Iran and the United States on Iraqi soil. Two days after the airstrike in 2020, the Iraqi parliament passed a resolution requiring the government to end the presence of foreign forces in the country. On Dec. 29, 2021, then Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi confirmed the end of the U.S.-led coalition's combat mission in Iraq after the withdrawal of their forces from the country.",Xinhua,2023-01-04 10:27

As the host of the North American Leaders' Summit next week, Lopez Obrador is set to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau here in the Mexican capital. Lopez Obrador plans to call on Biden to change the U.S. policy of ""intervening in"" countries throughout the Americas in a bid to dominate the Western Hemisphere. The Monroe Doctrine, formulated in the early 1800s by then U.S. President James Monroe, ""has been in place for 200 years,"" he told reporters during his daily press conference at the National Palace in Mexico City. The principle deems any intervention by external powers in the politics of the Americas as a potentially hostile act against the United States, and has been giving Washington reasons to exercise control over Latin America. ""Respect the autonomy and self-determination of the peoples. It is a very important change,"" said Lopez Obrador.

During a ceremony marking the 3rd anniversary of Soleimani's assassination in the capital Tehran, the crowds waved Iranian flags and chanted anti-American slogans. ""We have not forgotten and will not forget about avenging the top commander's blood,"" Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi told the crowds, describing Soleimani as the symbol of the fight against oppression and global arrogance.   ""We will not let murderers and those behind the crime sleep comfortably,"" Raisi vowed. Similar ceremonies were also held in the cities of Esfahan, Yazd and Soleimani's hometown Kerman. On Jan. 3, 2020, the U.S. military assassinated Soleimani and the deputy commander of Iraq's paramilitary Hashd Shaabi forces Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in a drone strike near the Baghdad International Airport in Iraq. The assassination was condemned by Iran as an act of ""state terrorism.""",Xinhua,2023-01-04 14:42

705,U.S. Apollo 7 astronaut Walter Cunningham dies at 90,"HOUSTON, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. astronaut Walt Cunningham, who flew into space on Apollo 7, the first crewed Apollo flight, died at 90 on Tuesday in Houston, according to a news release from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ""On Apollo 7, the first launch of a crewed Apollo mission, Walt and his crewmates made history, paving the way for the Artemis Generation we see today,"" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. Cunningham died of complications of a fall, his family said. A public memorial service will be held on Jan. 24 in Houston. Cunningham, who called being an astronaut ""one of the world's greatest jobs ever,"" was a U.S. Marine Corps fighter pilot before becoming an astronaut in 1963 as part of NASA's third astronaut class. He was designated the lunar module pilot for the 11-day flight of Apollo 7, which launched on Oct. 11, 1968 and was the first human flight test of the Apollo spacecraft. With Walter Schirra and Donn Eisele, he tested maneuvers necessary for docking and lunar orbit rendezvous using the third stage of their Saturn IB launch vehicle, according to NASA. The crew successfully completed eight tests, igniting the service module engine, measuring the accuracy of performance of all spacecraft systems, and providing the first live television transmission of onboard crew activities. The 263-hour and 4.5-million-mile flight splashed down on Oct. 22, 1968 in the Atlantic Ocean. ""Walt Cunningham was a fighter pilot, physicist, and an entrepreneur -- but, above all, he was an explorer,"" Nelson said. ""NASA will always remember his contributions to our nation's space program and sends our condolences to the Cunningham family."" ""The world has lost another true hero, and we will miss him dearly,"" the Cunningham family said in a statement. Born on March 16, 1932, Cunningham received a bachelor of arts with honors in physics in 1960 and a master of arts with distinction in physics in 1961 from the University of California at Los Angeles. He then completed a doctorate in physics with exception of thesis at the Advanced Management Program in the Harvard Business School in 1974. He joined the U.S. Navy in 1951 and served on active duty with the U.S. Marine Corps, retiring with the rank of colonel. He has accumulated more than 4,500 hours of flying time in 40 different aircraft, including more than 3,400 in jet aircraft. Cunningham retired from NASA in 1971 and went on to lead multiple technical and financial organizations. He also was a longtime investor and entrepreneur, organizing small businesses and private investment firms.",Xinhua,2023-01-04 16:32
706,Paralyzed U.S. House temporarily adjourns as political deadlock over speakership persists,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- Members of a paralyzed U.S. House of Representatives failed to elect a new speaker again on Wednesday afternoon with no end in sight to the political stalemate. The House voted to adjourn until early Wednesday night for closed-door negotiations after U.S. Congressman Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, failed to secure enough votes another three times due to intra-party division. House members voted three times on Tuesday, the opening day of the divided 118th Congress, but McCarthy fell short of the necessary 218 votes to be the next speaker. It was the first time a House speaker -- who maintains order, manages its proceedings, and governs the administration of its business on the lower chamber's floor -- hadn't been elected on the first ballot in 100 years. The 435-seat House will have to vote on and on until a speaker is elected with a majority of votes. Before that, members cannot be sworn in and committees cannot be formed with the rest of the business stalled. U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, reacted to the political drama surrounding the House speakership vote on Wednesday morning, saying that ""it's embarrassing the way it's taking so long."" ""How do you think this looks to the rest of the world?"" Biden told reporters at the White House before leaving for Hebron, Kentucky. ""It's not a good look. It's not a good thing."" McCarthy has the support of most House Republicans and former U.S. President Donald Trump, but a handful of hardliners have opposed his bid to lead the conference by arguing that he is insufficiently conservative while refusing to decentralize the speaker's power. Trump reaffirmed his support for McCarthy in a social media post on Wednesday morning, urging Republican House members to elect him and not to ""turn a great triumph into a giant &embarrassing defeat."" U.S. Congressman Matt Gaetz, a longtime Trump supporter and one of the House Republicans seeking to doom McCarthy's quest to take the gavel, responded in a statement that the former Republican president's suggestion ""changes neither my view of McCarthy nor Trump nor my vote."" McCarthy told reporters that ""I think we'll get to 218,"" as he appeared on Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning despite no clear path yet to break the historic deadlock. The House has elected a speaker 127 times since 1789. There have been 14 instances of speaker elections requiring multiple ballots. Thirteen of 14 multiple-ballot elections occurred before the Civil War, when party divisions were more nebulous, according to congressional historians. The last time a speaker election required two or more votes on the floor happened in 1923. This time, all House Democrats have voted for Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, to be speaker. Though it's unlikely for Jeffries to attain the position, he is set to become the first African American lawmaker to lead a party in either chamber of the U.S. Congress. Republicans flipped the House in the 2022 midterm elections while Democrats held onto their majority in the Senate.

717,Hungarian analysts hail China's new COVID approach,"   BUDAPEST, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- A Hungarian expert spoke highly of China's reaction to the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic and said he was optimistic about the Chinese government's new anti-COVID measures. ""China reacted well in the early stages of the pandemic, when it stopped the spread of the virus with national lockdowns and mass testing, and began developing its own vaccines,"" Zoltan Kiszelly, director of the Center of Political Analyses at Hungary's Szazadveg Institute, told Xinhua in a recent interview. China's health industry made a significant contribution to the global response to COVID-19 by exporting personal protective equipment (face masks, clothing) and syringes, according to Kiszelly. The delivery from China to Hungary of hundreds of thousands of doses of the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine in 2021 greatly contributed to the rapid and mass immunization of the Hungarian population, said the expert.   It also helped Hungary to reopen after lifting the lockdown earlier than many other countries of Western Europe, he said. The expert emphasized that in the early stages of the pandemic, China donated its own vaccine to allied third-world countries, which slowed the spread of the virus and helped the immunization of health workers and critical infrastructure workers. Kiszelly also praised China for obtaining the World Health Organization's (WHO) authorization for its Sinopharm vaccine, which enabled people to freely travel in Europe. It would be beneficial if the WHO, China, India, the United States, Russia and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) coordinated their licensing practices, he noted.   With its 90 percent COVID-19 vaccination rate, China's decision to reopen its borders is not irresponsible, he said. In most European countries the same decision was made when the vaccination rate was around 70 percent only. ""I am optimistic about the Chinese government's pandemic prevention and control measures, as China can draw on the experience of other countries and regions, and the organization of the country, the discipline of the Chinese people, and the performance capacity of the Chinese economy provide the necessary tools, logistics and public cooperation for the new phase of the fight against the pandemic,"" he said.   ""China understood that a complex problem requires a complex solution, and this is an excellent thing because nowadays complex thinking is a rare commodity,"" another expert, Andras Inotai, former general director of the Institute for World Economics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, told Xinhua. ""The pandemic is truly a global challenge for mankind, and I think leaders worldwide should cooperate to address it. They should also rely on the experience of China's 5,000-year-old culture, which has proven its resilience and capacity to adapt to face hard challenges,"" he said.",Xinhua,2023-01-05 10:42
725,Feature: Iranian youngsters learn more about China through drawing,"TEHRAN, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- ""My painting is both about modern China and traditional China,"" 13-year-old Mahshid Ghasemi said on Wednesday when introducing her work, which won the first prize in the first China-themed painting competition for Iranian children and teenagers. The contest, jointly organized by the Chinese Embassy in Iran and Iran's Institute for the Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults (Kanoon), was divided into two age groups, and received 427 paintings from young people across Iran. Each group was awarded one first prize, two second prizes, and three third prizes. An award ceremony and the opening ceremony of the drawing exhibition were held on Wednesday. The works showcased at the exhibition feature iconic elements of Chinese culture, such as red lanterns, the Great Wall, and dragons, demonstrating Iranian children's imagination and thinking about China. Ghasemi, from Isfahan province, said she used a dragon, fans, and ancient buildings to depict the traditional part of China with red as the main color and illustrated scenes of Chinese people celebrating the Lunar New Year. Meanwhile, in the modern China part, she focuses on China's skyscrapers and urban development, and there are also celebratory farmers, representing the country's progress in poverty alleviation. Ghasemi said that she is very interested in China, through movies, documentaries, and other ways to learn about China, which explains the complicated image in her painting. Mehrnaz Tolouei, the first prize winner in the 7-11 age group, painted a scene of ancient Persians trading with the Chinese on the ancient Silk Road routes, an idea inspired by his father, Mahmoud Tolouei. ""The ancient Silk Road connected China and Iran,"" he said, ""the two countries today enjoy a friendly relationship and their cultures should be reunited again to reconnect"" through these routes. Chinese Ambassador to Iran Chang Hua said that people-to-people and cultural exchanges between China and Iran have become increasingly close and active, further deepening mutual understanding and traditional friendship between the two peoples. This year's competition demonstrates Iranian youth's longing for China and their expectation for the continuance of China-Iran traditional friendship, Chang said, expressing his hope that the contest will serve as a starting point to further sow the seeds of friendship between the young people of the two countries so that China-Iran friendship will be passed on from generation to generation. Noting that Iranian literary and artistic works contain a lot of Chinese stories and elements, Hamed Alamati, Kanoon's general manager, said that his institute stands ready to work with the Chinese embassy to further bolster the exchanges between the young people of the two countries with painting, a common artistic language of mankind, and constantly enhance their mutual understanding. Such efforts will ""add new strength to the long-standing friendly exchanges between the two countries,"" Alamati added.",Xinhua,2023-01-05 10:50
718,Electricity supply affected by 72-hour strike in India's western state,"NEW DELHI, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- Electricity supply in parts of India's western state of Maharashtra was affected on Wednesday as thousands of the employees of three government-owned companies went on a 72-hour strike. The employees are protesting against the local government's move to privatize the power firms, and demanding it should not issue a parallel distribution licence to a private power subsidiary. Reports said the strike has hit electricity supply in nine districts of Maharashtra. Authorities have deployed police forces at sensitive places like power plants. Representative of Maharashtra State Electricity Workers' Federation Krushna Bhoir told the media that the protest was going on peacefully as the protesting employees were sitting in make-shift tents outside their establishments. Meanwhile, the local government has invoked the Maharashtra Essential Services Maintenance Act (MESMA) and asked the officials concerned to take all necessary steps to ensure normal supply of electricity in the state, according to media reports. The strike is set to continue until Friday and the employee unions have urged consumers to make backup arrangements.",Xinhua,2023-01-05 11:14
674,"UK PM pledges to halve inflation, boost economy","   LONDON, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- United Kingdom (UK) Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged to halve inflation and boost the country's economy in his first major speech in 2023 on Wednesday. Sunak made five pledges. These are: to halve inflation; to grow the economy; to reduce national debt; to cut hospital waiting lists; and to stop illegal migrant boats crossing the English Channel. Calling these the ""people's priorities,"" Sunak vowed to ""work night and day"" to deliver for the British people.   He said his government will halve inflation this year to reduce the cost of living and give people financial security. According to official figures, the UK's annual inflation dipped to 10.7 percent in November from 11.1 percent in October. Last November, the Bank of England (BoE) said it expected the country's consumer price index (CPI) to drop sharply after the middle of 2023. To grow the economy, Sunak pledged to create better-paid jobs and opportunities across the country. However, this may prove to be an uphill task. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the UK's gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.3 percent in the third quarter of 2022. The BoE also warned that the country's economy is bound to remain in recession throughout 2023 and the first half of 2024, and GDP will recover only gradually thereafter.   Reducing public debt has always been a priority for Sunak's fiscal policies since he took office in late October. In his Autumn Statement, Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt announced a package of tax hikes and spending cuts in a bid to improve the public finances and restore the country's economic credibility. In Sunak's fourth pledge, he promised that the waiting lists of the National Health Service (NHS) will fall and people will get the care they need more quickly. According to the British Medical Association (BMA), in October 2022, a record 7.21 million people were waiting for medical treatment in the UK. Sunak also vowed to pass new laws to curb the arrival of migrants in ""small boats,"" on the country's coast. ""If you come to this country illegally, you are detained and swiftly removed,"" he said.   The Times newspaper cited official figures as showing that a record 45,756 migrants crossed the English Channel to the UK last year. In his speech, Sunak also said that he plans to ensure that all pupils in the country study maths until the age of 18. He said the UK was one of the few countries in the world not to require children to study maths in some form up to that age. ""Improving education,"" he said, ""is the closest thing to a silver bullet there is. It is the best economic policy, the best social policy, the best moral policy.""",Xinhua,2023-01-05 11:16
676,Interview: Philippine expert expects China's COVID policy adjustment to add new impetus to world economy,"MANILA, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- As its COVID-19 strategy has been adjusted to the changing situation of the pandemic in a planned, science-based approach, China's economy will likely see a ""robust recovery"" and help boost global economic growth in 2023, a Philippine expert has said. Given the relatively mild Omicron variant, a better-equipped health system and a largely vaccinated population in China, ""I think that new policies on COVID-19 are one way of simulating and preparing for"" a wider opening of the Chinese economy to the world in the near future, Anna Malindog-Uy, vice president of the Manila-based think tank Asian Century Philippines Strategic Studies Institute, told Xinhua in a recent interview. The optimized anti-COVID measures will not only ""revitalize economic activities and investments in the country,"" but also ""benefit the wider international community,"" she said. ""The outlook for the Chinese economy in 2023 is definitely positive. I believe China's economic development will soar high,"" said the researcher, who reckoned the Chinese economy will be ""on an upward trajectory, helping pull up the downward economic trajectory of the world while boosting the recovery of the world economy."" As the world's second-largest economy, one of the biggest consumer markets, and a major trading partner of almost all economies, the wider China opens to the world, the more other countries will benefit from it through economic and trade cooperation, she said. ""It is not only a huge market, but it has a substantial middle-class population with a relatively high purchasing capacity compared to other countries in the developing world."" In addition, a further opening of the Chinese market and economy will ""reinvigorate the global industrial and supply chains, and countries around the globe will also benefit from this,"" Malindog-Uy said. From the anti-COVID battle to the post-pandemic recovery, China has always stood with other developing countries. ""I'm impressed with China's generosity and solidarity with the rest of the world, especially during the initial onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" the expert said, citing cooperation between China and the Philippines to curb the pandemic as an example. Their cooperation ""has been critical in the Philippines' quest for a quick economic bounce back and recovery from the economic devastation brought by the pandemic,"" she added. China has contributed to the pandemic response of the Philippines ""unprecedentedly."" The list of China's donations includes billions of pesos worth of medical supplies and equipment, and most notably, millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines, Malindog-Uy said. ""China is the first country to send and donate vaccines to the Philippines that made it possible for the Philippine government to kick off its COVID-19 national vaccination program sooner than later,"" she said. ""Indeed, China is a friend of the Philippines especially in times of need,"" she concluded.",Xinhua,2023-01-05 13:07
679,Feature: Filipino durian growers eye more income as exports to China cleared,"MANILA, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- Jomar Abdon, 29, took on one of Davao City's durian processing facility's critical tasks: sorting durians. Standing in front of a pile of durians, he sorted out skillfully the high-quality spiky fruits and prepared them for packaging. Abdon is happy that China cleared the exportation of Philippine durians to China on Wednesday, saying that the move could raise the income of the local growers of the tropical fruit in Davao City, the Philippines' third largest city. Abdon's daily workload is likely to increase as a result. ""Our durians in Davao City are more delicious. For us, it is better to have our produce recognized by (China) and exported (there). It is an added income to farmers. More people will benefit from the proceeds,"" he said. As one of the most lucrative fruits that command a good price in the world's largest consumer market, access to the enormous Chinese market is a bonanza for Filipino durian growers, especially those in Davao City, whose durian production accounts for about 80 percent of the national total. The local durian season in Davao City is from July to October every year. Compared to other renowned durian varieties, the popular varieties in Davao City, namely Puyat and D101, are more resistant to pests and more productive. Candelario Miculob, the former head of Davao City's Durian Planters Association, told Xinhua that Davao City currently produces more than 50,000 tons of durian annually, with over 3,000 growers and more than five processing factories. According to Miculob, if each household is calculated based on the planting area of 1 hectare with 100 bearing trees, each family will have an additional income of about 2,800 U.S. dollars. After the opening up of the Chinese market, he said China will become the Philippines' largest durian export destination. ""We are encouraging farmers to plant more. It will increase the farmers' income, hopefully, improve their livelihood, and help reduce poverty. The two countries will improve their agricultural cooperation, and the Philippines will benefit from the increased agricultural output through the durian export,"" he added. According to the Philippine Department of Agriculture, around 9,696 direct jobs and 1,126 indirect jobs will be generated after Philippine durians are cleared to export to China. Direct jobs include additional workforce in farm and packing facilities, while indirect jobs include those in packaging, logistics and other services sectors. In recent years, the Philippines and China have achieved fruitful agricultural cooperation, bringing tangible benefits to the people of the two countries. With bananas, pineapples, mangos, young coconuts, and avocados from the Philippines being put on the table of the Chinese people, China has already established itself as one of the top importers of Philippine agricultural products. This position is expected to grow stronger as China seeks to expand its Philippine fruit imports further to boost agricultural cooperation between the two countries. Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian said the first of the four major areas of cooperation identified by leaders of the two countries, is agricultural cooperation. He said that although the tropical fruits in the Philippines are of high quality, the income level of the large population of fruit farmers is relatively low. ""Therefore, we hope some Philippine fruits that are popular with Chinese consumers can be exported to China, and durian is one of the best choices. We look forward to Philippine durians being placed on the dining table of the Chinese people soon,"" he added.",Xinhua,2023-01-05 13:30
677,"Russian student thanks TCM, people in COVID-19 fight","BEIJING, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- A couple of weeks ago, Russian student Yulia Temelidi caught Omicron in China, but she recovered soon with the help of a small health kit with different types of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). ""Unlike Western medicines, TCM tends to have less side effects, and my body will accept TCM a little bit more calmly,"" said Temelidi, who studies at China's Tsinghua University. Having lived in China for years, she holds the view that TCM has played an important role in fighting the virus over the past three years. She even recommends TCM to her best friend, who now takes it as a wonder for the successful treatment of many kinds of diseases. Temelidi has found TCM very useful even before her Omicron infection. ""The TCM health kit could help me a lot when I have a headache or a stomachache or just a small fever. In winter, the medicine called Qingyandiwan helped me a lot with sore throat."" Temelidi said that during the past three years of fight against virus variants, China had provided good protection to its people as well as foreigners in China. During the first pop-out of COVID-19, Temelidi was in China staying at home. Very few things about the coronavirus were well understood by scientists at that time, and China made strict prevention and control policies to protect people, she said. ""At that time, the only thing that I could do is to stay at home,"" she said, noting COVID-19 was absolutely really horrible then. In 2021, Temelidi learned that some of her friends in Russia caught COVID-19, and it seemed like a horrible experience. ""They were having a type of Alpha virus or Delta virus. One of my friends experienced a fever of about 40 degrees Celsius for more than a week. He couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, didn't have any taste in his mouth, and it was absolutely horrible."" In her eyes, China raced against time during the three years to inoculate its people and conduct research on possible new medicines. In her three years of study, the international student was impressed with warmth and goodwill from surrounding people. As she had to study online sometimes, the Russian student felt worried at the beginning. ""Actually, I've been kind of anxious and kind of worried that I couldn't get everything that I needed, such as the proper amount of knowledge, and I don't have a clear idea of how to live in China. But people around me, including all the professors, helped me a lot. My professors told me to message them every time I had a question, and they would answer me very soon,"" Temelidi said. She also spoke highly of the medical staff doing regular nucleic acid tests. ""I want to say a huge thank you to them, because, first of all, it's really hard for them to wake up in morning to the same job every time. This is very hard and very challenging for their body, for their health,"" she said, adding that the medics were braving the biggest risk of actually getting COVID-19 for the sake of others' health. With China's optimized prevention and control policies, she now plans to spend the coming Spring Festival in south China's resort city of Guilin. ""With evolving COVID-19 response strategy, our life is returning to normal,"" said Temelidi.",Xinhua,2023-01-05 14:00
680,US once-in-a-century political chaos disturb the world,"  Right before the second anniversary of the Capitol riots, on January 3, 2023, another political chaos, dubbed by CNN as a ""horror show,"" happened in the same place. US House of Representatives went through a ""difficult labor"" of a new speaker after three rounds of voting failed. The last time a House speaker vote went to multiple ballots was 100 years ago. Tuesday's occurrence was truly a once-in-a-century phenomenon. During Capitol riots, American rioters shocked the building from the outside. This time, the stalemate was the result of conflicts from inside the Capitol. The two events are chaotic phenomena of spread and aggravation of the disease of US political system. The one who failed to pass the three rounds of the votes for US House speaker is Kevin McCarthy. In the eyes of outsiders, he is a well-known ultra-conservative politician. He is against Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, and promised to overturn a number of relevant legislations that Washington has passed. His crazy anti-China remarks also left a very bad impression on the Chinese people. However, astonishingly, McCarthy was not opposed because of his radicalism, but because he was considered not tough enough by some more radical congressmen in the Republican Party. It shows how severe the division and polarization in the US politics are. What happened in the highest hall of ""US democracy"" is not a simple farce, but a political thriller with huge destructiveness, and a wide-ranging and far-reaching impact. This not only worries Americans, but also political observers from quite a few countries internationally. While the antagonism between political parties in the US continues to escalate, the internal divisions in the Republican and the Democratic parties have become increasingly prominent. At this time, a completely irrational and dangerous tendency has surfaced in Washington: finding or creating an ""enemy"" outside the US to suppress, alleviate and divert political divisions within the country. As a result, China, which is developing rapidly in economy and has a different political system and ideology from the US, is forcibly being established as an ""enemy of the US."" Some lawmakers are scrambling to show their toughness toward China. The tougher, the better. They will gradually fall into collective self-hypnosis, and will keep a blind eye on the fact that the enemy of ""US democracy"" is actually the US itself. The US House of Representatives will continue to vote on Wednesday, but to some extent the result is no longer important. McCarthy is intensely negotiating with his opponents in the Republican Party. To put it bluntly, it is a political exchange, and he is likely to make a more ""tough"" promise in the future. If McCarthy is still elected after some tossing and turning, then his extreme words and actions may intensify. In fact, the current difficult status of China-US relations has a lot to do with US sick party politics. Meanwhile, the electoralization of political party functions, the frequent emergence of extreme issues, and the rise of veto politics has spilled over from the US to many countries and international institutions, causing widespread concerns and seriously hindering international cooperation. History proves that political parties' ""being at daggers drawn"" in the US Congress often indicates major turmoil. Before this time, there have been 14 times in the history of the US that Congress was unable to elect a speaker in the first round of voting, 13 of which occurred before the Civil War, and the elections in 1855 and 1859 before the outbreak of the war were among the most voted - 133 and 44 times respectively. Amid rising political animosity, 90 percent of Americans expect 2023 to be a year of political conflict in the US, according to the latest Gallup poll. More than 70 percent of Americans disapprove of the performance of Congress, according to a previous Gallup poll. This reflects a general disappointment in the US society with its domestic politics, and also shows that the ""anti-democracy"" in the US has developed to an advanced stage, and has caused it to be trapped in the cocoon of ""veto politics,"" losing the momentum of innovation, and will become more radical in the future. Such a US is dangerous to the world. Faced with the political chaos in the US, Canada's Globe and Mail raised a sharp question: whether the political class of the country is able to govern, and whether the internal conflicts and contradictions of one of the major political parties contaminate the entire system. Another Canadian media quoted a research report saying that the toxic political culture in Washington and across the US was spilling over the border. ""Canada is picking up the political radicalization bug from the US."" It seems that as Canada is a close neighbor of the US, its feeling is very distinct. When such a US shamelessly claims the world cannot lose US leadership, isn't that horrific?", (Global Times) ,2023-01-05 14:37
682,New Zealand's tourism to be greatly boosted with influx of Chinese tourists,"WELLINGTON, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- The orderly resumption of outbound travel for Chinese tourists will be ""a major boon to New Zealand's tourism industry,"" said Lisa Li, a travel operator specialising in the Chinese market. It is great news that the Chinese market will now rebuild, said Li, managing director of New Zealand's largest travel agency, China Travel Service (NZ) Ltd., who also revealed that there were already more inquiries from Chinese tour groups. As with Li, New Zealand's Chinese tour guide Uncle Rong has been busy communicating with China's travel agencies and customizing the latest tour itineraries to prepare for Chinese tourists visiting New Zealand this summer. Nearly 36 million Chinese people are looking to New Zealand as a preferred vacation destination, showed a survey conducted by Tourism New Zealand at the end of 2019. ""The New Zealand tourism industry is very excited about the upcoming arrival of Chinese tourists,"" Rong said. Grant Bradley, a senior reporter of NZ Herald, deems the re-opening of China crucial for New Zealand's tourism, saying the decision made by China could send a wave of Chinese tourists to destinations like New Zealand. Spending by international tourists increased 30.6 percent in the year ending March 2022, and New Zealand is looking forward to seeing another jump in the year ending March 2023, said Tourism Minister Stuart Nash on Monday. ""Our regions have already seen a boost in tourism spending and this looks set to continue in the summer months,"" said the minister. The return of international tourists benefits employment and promotes the economy, Nash said, citing figures that tourism directly employed 145,032 people in the year to March 2022, up by 3,615 year on year. Chinese tourists not only travel to New Zealand during peak summer months, but also make a significant contribution to New Zealand's tourism in low seasons, helping maintain New Zealand's tourism workforce and improve the industry's overall hospitality capacity, Li said. The sound bilateral ties and New Zealand's good image in the international tourism market have made Chinese tourists consider the country as a tourist destination, she added. About 1,000 Chinese tourists arrived in New Zealand in the week early last month, a significant increase from three months earlier, according to the country's statistics agency Stats NZ. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, China was already New Zealand's second biggest tourism market after Australia, and spending by Chinese visitors hit 1.7 billion New Zealand dollars (1.07 billion U.S. dollars) in 2019, showed data from Stats NZ.",Xinhua,2023-01-05 14:41
683,Political deadlock continues in U.S. House after 4 rounds of voting on speakership,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- Members of a paralyzed U.S. House of Representatives failed to elect a new speaker again on Wednesday afternoon with no end in sight to the political stalemate. U.S. Congressman Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, failed to secure enough votes for the fourth time after 21 House lawmakers of his own party didn't vote for him. The House voted three times on Tuesday, the opening day of the divided 118th Congress, but McCarthy fell short of the necessary 218 votes to be the next speaker. It was the first time a House speaker -- who maintains order, manages its proceedings, and governs the administration of its business on the lower chamber's floor -- hadn't been elected on the first ballot in 100 years. The 435-seat House will have to vote on and on until a speaker is elected with a majority of votes. Before that, members cannot be sworn in and committees cannot be formed with the rest of the business stalled. U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, reacted to the political drama surrounding the House speakership vote on Wednesday morning, saying that ""it's embarrassing the way it's taking so long."" ""How do you think this looks to the rest of the world?"" Biden told reporters at the White House before leaving for Hebron, Kentucky. ""It's not a good look. It's not a good thing."" McCarthy has the support of most House Republicans and former U.S. President Donald Trump but a handful of hardliners have opposed his bid to lead the conference by arguing that he is insufficiently conservative while refusing to decentralize the speaker's power. Trump reaffirmed his support for McCarthy on Wednesday morning, urging Republican House members to elect him and not to ""turn a great triumph into a giant &embarrassing defeat"" in a social media post. U.S. Congressman Matt Gaetz, a longtime Trump supporter and one of the House Republicans seeking to doom McCarthy's quest to take the gavel, responded in a statement that the former Republican president's suggestion ""changes neither my view of McCarthy nor Trump nor my vote."" McCarthy told reporters that ""I think we'll get to 218,"" as he appeared on Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning despite no clear path yet to break the historic deadlock. The House has elected a speaker 127 times since 1789. There have been 14 instances of speaker elections requiring multiple ballots. Thirteen of 14 multiple-ballot elections occurred before the Civil War, when party divisions were more nebulous, according to congressional historians. The last time a speaker election required two or more votes on the floor happened in 1923. This time, all House Democrats have voted for Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, to be speaker.

686,China a key buyer of Cambodia's agricultural products,"PHNOM PENH, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- China is one of the key importers of Cambodia's agricultural produce in 2022, according to a report released by the Cambodian Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries on Thursday. The report said China had purchased a number of Cambodian agricultural products, particularly milled rice, yellow bananas, mangoes, cassava, cashew nuts, corns, longans and pepper, among others. It added that 689,702 tons of Cambodian agricultural products had been shipped to China during the January-November period in 2022. Cambodian Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Dith Tina said China still has much potential to absorb more Cambodian agricultural products, saying that neither country has yet used the maximum potential in this sector. ""Cambodia and China have solid agricultural cooperation, and we have exported rice, mangoes, bananas, and, most recently, longans to China,"" he told Xinhua in a recent interview. ""I would like to encourage all stakeholders of the two countries to promote closer and closer cooperation to find new, better, and more effective ways to respond to the potential we have,"" he added. Tina said the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement and the Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA), which took effect in January last year, have injected a new impetus into the development of Cambodia's agriculture. ""The RCEP and the CCFTA are all free trade agreements that mutually open the market in all participating countries, thus giving farmers choices to export their agricultural products to various countries,"" he said. ""Both FTAs will contribute not only to the agriculture sector's growth, but also to the farmers' welfare and prosperity."" Agriculture is one of the four pillars supporting Cambodia's economy.

687,Six global issues to resolve in 2023,"   BEIJING, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- The year of 2022 saw a world in turmoil: the United States fueled one conflict after another, the Ukraine crisis dragged on, the COVID-19 pandemic lingered on with Omicron emerging as the new strain. Inflation, food crisis, energy security, a sluggish world economic recovery, a worrisome climate and stalled climate negotiations ... These overlapping challenges have tested humanity beyond measure. Looking ahead to 2023, solutions remain in sight to these seemingly intractable problems so long as countries jointly deliver real, concrete actions.  The crisis in Ukraine escalated on Feb. 24, 2022, when Russia launched a special military operation against Ukraine. Since then, the U.S.-led West has continued to provide military and economic aid to Ukraine, turning the conflict into a protracted one. The United States and its allies have also imposed tough sanctions on Russia on an unprecedented scale, but have failed to crush the Russian economy.   At present, the Russian and Ukrainian forces are basically caught in a stalemate. Due to huge divisions between the two sides, it is difficult to resolve the crisis through negotiations in the short term. The United States continued to fan the flame by announcing an additional 1.85 billion U.S. dollars in military aid to Ukraine, including the Patriot air defense system. The U.S. Congress also passed recently the omnibus bill for 2023, which includes up to 45 billion dollars in emergency funding for Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russia lately signaled a military buildup by announcing plans to beef up its armed forces to 1.5 million from 1.15 million. It remains unpredictable whether the crisis will come to an end or escalate further in 2023, the evolvement of which largely hinges on whether the Western countries can withstand the enormous burden on their economies and national defense from continued aid to Ukraine.  Over the past year, Omicron, a mutated new coronavirus variant, has become the dominant strain in the global pandemic. Omicron is more infectious than previously prevalent strains, has multiple subtypes, and has triggered waves of new outbreaks in countries around the world. However, its pathogenicity is significantly lower, and so is the rate of serious illness and mortality due to infection, prompting countries around the world to gradually adjust their epidemic prevention policies.   WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has recently voiced his hope of declaring COVID-19 no longer a global health emergency sometime in 2023, and a WHO emergency committee will meet in January to discuss the criteria for declaring such an end. To battle COVID, scientists around the world are making unremitting efforts to develop next-generation vaccines and antiviral drugs. With the progress of the research and development of COVID vaccine and drugs, humankind will be armed with more weapons against viruses and a strong shield against COVID.  In 2022, the world economy is beset by multiple difficulties, especially inflation, which has hamstrung many countries. The U.S.-led Western countries have previously implemented ultra-loose monetary policy for a long time to cope with the pandemic and stimulate the economy, sowing the seeds for skyrocketing inflation. Following the escalation of the Ukraine crisis, Western sanctions against Russia further obstructed the international supply chain already disrupted by the pandemic. The hiking energy and food prices further pushed up inflation, and the price rise of commodities in many European and American countries hit a 40-year high. To curb inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates swiftly and aggressively, causing other economies' currencies to depreciate sharply and fueling their imported inflation. Many countries have been forced to follow the United States in raising interest rates, triggering fears of recession. In its World Economic Outlook report released in October 2022, the International Monetary Fund projects global economic growth at 2.7 percent in 2023, down 0.2 percentage points from its July forecast, with the global economy facing significant downside risks. However, with the release of pent-up demand and the combination of policy effects, China's economy will show clear momentum for recovery and growth, which will add sustained impetus and bring opportunities and confidence to the world economy.  In 2022, the U.S. Democratic and Republican parties continued their bickering, with deep rifts on a range of issues, including abortion rights, gun control and immigration. In the midterm elections held in November 2022, Republicans seized control of the House of Representatives, while Democrats narrowly retained control of the Senate.   With both parties eyeing the 2024 presidential election and the new Congress ""divided"" between the House and the Senate, the Republican Party is expected to pose more challenges to the Joe Biden administration in 2023, leaving its current domestic and foreign policies in a welter of great uncertainty. The strife within the Republican Party is also likely to intensify. Moderates in the Republican Party may consider dropping their support for Donald Trump, who is planning to run for president in the next election but did poorly in the midterms. Meanwhile, Republicans' narrow majority in the House of Representatives may give the party's extremist wing more opportunity to sway its position in Congress. Amid political polarization and intensified infighting, U.S. politics remain shrouded by uncertainties, which will affect the U.S. foreign policy and bring about more complexities to the world.  In 2022, under U.S. interference, many countries in the Asia-Pacific faced varying degrees of shocks and mounting regional tensions. One year after the withdrawal of U.S. troops, Afghanistan is still mired in a grave security and humanitarian crisis. On the Korean Peninsula, tensions escalated after the United States and South Korea repeatedly held large-scale joint military drills, prompting the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to counter with missile launches. With the support of the United States, Japan has recently officially adopted three key defense documents including a new version of the National Security Strategy, which proposes to build a so-called ""counterstrike capability,"" a de facto pre-emptive attack capability, and will significantly increase military spending in the next five years, arousing concern in the international community. Foreseeably, the United States will continue to form cliques and foment trouble in the Asia-Pacific region. Peace will remain a luxury in the region in 2023.  Climate change is a major challenge facing humanity. In 2022, the mega-floods in Pakistan killed more than 1,000 people. The summer heat and drought in Europe dried up the headwaters of the Thames and nearly shut down the Rhine. The recent winter storms that nearly swept across the United States have killed dozens of people. These appalling extreme weather events serve as a grim reminder that it brooks no delay to tackle climate change.   In November 2022, the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP27) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Developed countries remained passive in providing financial and technical support to developing countries, and had yet to deliver their pledged funding of 100 billion dollars a year. As a highlight of the meeting, the conference finally agreed to establish a ""loss and damage"" fund to provide financial assistance to the most vulnerable and hardest hit by climate change, but this is only a first step. Still subject to negotiations in 2023 are key issues such as the form of the fund, funding countries, allocation methods and assistance targets. Currently, developed economies don't fare well. Confronted with strained energy supply, some developed countries have switched back to coal for power generation and become increasingly unwilling to cut their own emissions and support developing countries in doing so. Under such circumstances, all eyes are on whether the COP28, scheduled for 2023 in Dubai, UAE, will make a difference on the above key issues.",Xinhua,2023-01-06 08:17
681,Putin orders Christmas truce with Ukraine on Jan. 6-7,"   MOSCOW, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed the country's Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to start a 36-hour truce along the entire line of contact between the parties in Ukraine from Jan. 6 to 7, the Kremlin said Thursday. ""Taking into account the appeal of His Holiness Patriarch Kirill, I instruct the Russian Defense Minister to introduce a ceasefire regime along the entire line of contact between the parties in Ukraine from 12:00 (0900 GMT) on January 6 to 24:00 (2100 GMT) on January 7,"" the Kremlin said in a statement. Putin also called on Kiev to declare a ceasefire based on the fact that a large number of Orthodox citizens live in the combat areas, according to the statement.",Xinhua,2023-01-06 08:59
689,Interview: China's optimized COVID-19 strategy gives new hope to global economic recovery: Thai expert,"BANGKOK, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- As China is the major growth engine for economic development of the Asia-Pacific and the wider world, its optimized COVID-19 strategy has injected fresh imputes into the global economic recovery, a Thai expert has said. Noting that the COVID-19 pandemic has been a global disaster for human society, Wirun Phichaiwongphakdee, director of the Thailand-China Research Center of the Belt and Road Initiative, said in a recent interview with Xinhua that the Chinese government has constantly optimized its COVID-19 response measures based on the evolvement of the pandemic and the deepening study on the virus. China's COVID-19 response measures have been science-based and a testimony to putting the people's interests first -- nothing being more precious than people's lives, he said, adding that China has played an indispensable role in the global fight against the pandemic and recovery of the world economy. The swift and decisive measures undertaken by the Chinese government to contain the outbreak at the very beginning have won precious time for other countries, he said. ""The time that China has won for others and its experience to contain the outbreak were very precious for the neighboring countries and the wider world to prepare for the pandemic."" He said China's constant adjustment and optimization of pandemic response measures are based on the increasing scientific understanding of the virus and the disease. Wirun, who has inoculated the COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by China, said he has been impressed by China's solidarity and cooperation with the global community in overcoming the pandemic. China has provided COVID-19 vaccines to many developing countries, including Thailand, he said, adding that the vaccines arrived at the height of the pandemic in his country and have played a critical role in Thailand's efforts to contain the outbreak. ""As Thailand is an aging society, more people could have lost their lives without these Chinese vaccines and other assistance provided by China."" The resumption of work and production in China has played a vital role in providing other countries with critical supplies in fighting COVID-19 and their subsequent efforts to achieve economic recovery. ""China is the major growth engine for economic development of the Asia-Pacific and the world, and its manufacturing sectors are known for high quality and high efficiency."" ""Without 'Made in China', the global economic recovery would have been a non-starter,"" he added. Wirun also pointed out that the cooperation under the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative has enhanced relations between China and countries in its neighborhood, including Thailand. The China-Laos Railway, for example, has boosted regional connectivity, according to him. As China's optimized COVID-19 strategy takes effect, people-to-people exchanges and the connectivity between China and other parts of the world will be further strengthened, and the world will see a new hope for recovery, he said. China recently announced that it would downgrade its management of the infectious disease of COVID-19 from Class A to Class B, starting from Jan. 8, 2023, shifting the focus of the response from stemming infection to caring for infected patients and preventing severe cases.",Xinhua,2023-01-06 09:13
688,Passenger volume exceeds 9 million on China-Laos Railway,"  KUNMING, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- Since its launch in December 2021, the China-Laos Railway had handled over 9 million passenger trips as of Thursday, said the China Railway Kunming Group Co., Ltd. Some 7.54 million passenger trips were registered in the railway's China section, while about 1.46 million were logged in its Laos section. Since the beginning of 2023, the railway has seen a growing momentum in its passenger volume, with its average daily dispatched number of passengers reaching 29,000, which almost doubled compared with the same period in 2022. The China section has added multiple-unit trains to 20 pairs daily on average to meet the increasing passenger travel demand, said the group. As a landmark project of high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, the 1,035-km China-Laos Railway connects Kunming, capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province, with the Laotian capital Vientiane.",Xinhua,2023-01-06 09:20
684,"Indian capital records nearly 4,500 dengue cases, 9 related deaths in 2022","NEW DELHI, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- Indian capital New Delhi recorded 4,469 cases of dengue and nine related deaths in 2022, data released by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) on Thursday showed. As per data, the highest number of dengue cases in Delhi were logged in October with 1,238 cases and November with 1,420 cases. In the month of December, 874 cases were reported, the data showed. Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that has rapidly spread in all regions in recent years. The virus is transmitted by female mosquitoes. Health experts say those who become infected with the virus a second time are at a significantly greater risk of developing severe disease. It causes fever, body aches, nausea, vomiting, internal bleeding, or a fatal drop in blood pressure in severe cases. In 2021, according to MCD, Delhi reported 9,613 dengue cases and 23 related deaths. Likewise in 2020, the number of dengue cases recorded in Delhi was 1,072, and one related death. Health experts say cases of vector-borne diseases such as dengue and malaria are usually reported between July and November, sometimes stretching until mid-December.",Xinhua,2023-01-06 09:27

729,No speaker in U.S. House elected as voting drama drags on,"   WASHINGTON, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of Representatives hasn't elected a new speaker as the election entered the third day on Thursday. U.S. Congressman Kevin McCarthy from California, the House Republican leader, fell short of the necessary votes to take the gavel in two more rounds of voting Thursday afternoon. The 435-seat lower chamber -- where Republicans have a slim majority over Democrats -- is unable to conduct any legislative business until a speaker is elected. The 118th Congress convened on Tuesday with newly-elected and re-elected senators sworn in while the House has been holding the speaker election for three days. McCarthy has the support of most House Republicans and former U.S. President Donald Trump but a handful of hardliners have pressured him to decentralize the speaker's power. It was the first time a House speaker -- who maintains order, manages its proceedings, and governs the administration of its business on the lower chamber's floor -- hadn't been elected on the first ballot in 100 years. All House Democrats have voted for Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, to be speaker in the election. Though it's unlikely for Jeffries to attain the position, he is set to become the first African American lawmaker to lead a party in either chamber of the U.S. Congress. Republicans flipped the House in the 2022 midterm elections and Democrats held onto their majority in the Senate. U.S. President Joe Biden said Wednesday that it's ""embarrassing for the country"" not to have a fully functional Congress, the legislature of the federal government.",Xinhua,2023-01-06 10:19
721,U.S. gov't announces measures to crack down on illegal immigration,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government announced Thursday new measures to crack down on illegal immigration. The measures will ""expand and expedite legal pathways for orderly migration"" and ""result in new consequences for those who fail to use those legal pathways,"" said the White House. Individuals who ""attempt to enter the United States without permission, do not have a legal basis to remain, and cannot be expelled pursuant to Title 42"" will be increasingly subject to expedited removal to their country of origin and subject to a five-year ban on re-entry, according to the White House release. Title 42 is a U.S. public health authority that also allows border officials to swiftly expel migrants and asylum-seekers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Before asking Congress for funding on Thursday, U.S. President Joe Biden said from the White House that the country's immigration system is ""broken."" He will travel to El Paso, Texas, to assess border enforcement operations on Sunday. Texas Governor Greg Abbott and at least two other Republican governors sent thousands of migrants from their states to cities led by Democrats last year to protest against the Biden administration's immigration policies and what they called federal inaction to secure America's southern border.",Xinhua,2023-01-06 10:43
722,Ukraine's GDP plunges record 30.4 pct in 2022,"KIEV, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's GDP declined by a record 30.4 percent last year due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the country's Economy Ministry said Thursday, citing preliminary estimates. ""In 2022, the Ukrainian economy suffered its largest losses and damage in the entire history of independence,"" said the ministry's press service, quoting Yulia Svyrydenko, the first deputy prime minister and economy minister. In December 2022, Ukraine's GDP declined 34 percent due to a certain stabilization of the situation with energy supply, after a fall of 37 percent in November, the ministry said. In the fourth quarter of last year, Ukraine's economy experienced a decline of 35.5 percent compared with the same period in 2021, it said. The Ukrainian economy saw a 3.4-percent growth in 2021. The country's GDP is expected to rise 3.2 percent this year, according to the government's projection.",Xinhua,2023-01-06 10:45

724,Chinese envoy calls for efforts to defuse Israeli-Palestinian tensions over holy site,"UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese envoy on Thursday called on the parties concerned to exercise restraint to prevent escalation of tensions following new Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir's visit to the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in East Jerusalem. China is deeply worried about the rise of tensions as a result of Ben-Gvir's visit, said Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the United Nations. In recent years, unilateral actions at the holy site in East Jerusalem have intensified problems and confrontations, triggering bloody conflicts many times. This truly reflects the sensitivity of the character and status of the holy site, he told the Security Council. ""China calls for the restoration and maintenance of peace and tranquility at the holy site, and calls on parties concerned to remain calm and restrained to prevent further escalation of tensions,"" said Zhang. ""Israel, in particular, should stop all incitements and provocations, and should refrain from any unilateral action that may lead to the deterioration of the situation."" China stands for upholding international rule of law and abiding by the international consensus on Jerusalem. Security Council resolutions unequivocally condemn all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem. The parties concerned should earnestly maintain the status quo of the holy site in Jerusalem and respect Jordan's custodianship, as set out in relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, he said. Having noticed the Israeli leader's expression of commitment to maintaining the status quo of the holy site, China hopes this commitment can be translated into constructive policies and actions, he said. What underlies the repeated cycles of tensions between Palestinians and Israelis is the repeatedly delayed implementation of the two-state solution. Facts have proved once again that piecemeal crisis management can hardly play an effective role, much less can it replace a comprehensive and just solution, said Zhang. The international community should, with a sense of urgency, promote the resumption of peace talks between Palestinians and Israelis as soon as possible on the basis of the two-state solution, resolve Jerusalem and other final-status issues, and realize the peaceful coexistence of Palestine and Israel at an early date. Countries of significant influence should assume responsibility and effectively play a constructive role, he said. China supports the establishment of a fully sovereign and independent Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital. China will continue to work with the international community to make positive contributions to the comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the Palestine question and the attainment of durable peace and common security in the Middle East, he said.

""It's difficult to see what relevance (this requirement) would have,"" Danish news agency Ritzau quoted Christian Wejse, senior physician and professor of global medicine at Aarhus University, as saying. ""The number of coronavirus cases is already high in Denmark, mostly with the Omicron variant, so I'm not sure what benefit it would bring.""   While acknowledging that testing was not particularly time-consuming or expensive, the professor said the effect of such requirement was minimal. ""But I think it is essential to look at what it (the testing requirement) will lead to.

Some European countries such as Italy, Spain and France had followed the strategy that China ""effectively put in place in the early phases of the pandemic,"" said Antoine Flahault, director of the Institute of Global Health at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Geneva.

""The Chinese government did apply very strict and effective measures at the time to tackle the pandemic and to avoid its spread all over the country."" Before a full deployment of vaccines, China and a lot of countries in the Asia-Pacific region had adopted a zero-COVID strategy, which was ""more effective than the Western response at that time,"" said the expert. With the mutation of the virus, the popularization of vaccination, and the accumulation of experience in prevention and control, China has announced that it will downgrade management of the disease from Class A to Class B starting from Jan. 8. From the experience of some countries after adjusting the zero-COVID strategy, a priority for the transitional period is to ""vaccinate the vulnerable segments of the population,"" Flahault said.",Xinhua,2023-01-06 14:27

660,What to expect in world's 7 major regions in 2023?,"   BEIJING, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- As changes unseen in a century are unfolding at a rapid pace, the world's seven major regions, namely the Asia-Pacific, North America, Europe, Eurasia, the Middle East, Latin America and Africa, will see a mix of tailwinds and headwinds in 2023. The world is not yet a tranquil place and humanity can't pretend that all problems will go away in the new year. Yet despite crises and challenges, peace and development, fairness and win-win cooperation will remain the common aspiration of people all over the world. A tough year has gone by. A new start is in front of the world.  In 2023, the Asia-Pacific will continue to enjoy a relatively stable security situation, robust economic growth and strong desire for cooperation. At the same time, certain countries' persistent interference to other countries' internal affairs will pose a grave challenge to regional peace and stability. Over the past year, the United States has continued to advance the so-called ""Indo-Pacific strategy"" in the region. U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has gathered allies and some regional countries to strengthen the ""small circle"" against China. In 2023, only by strengthening the will to maintain regional stability and deepening mutual trust can the Asia-Pacific region cement the foundation of regional security and drive the global recovery forwards.   In 2023, which marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative, China is considering hosting the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. India takes over the rotating presidency of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Group of 20. Indonesia holds the rotating chair of ASEAN ... Asia will once again capture spotlight for promoting global governance. The Asian-Pacific countries have full confidence in the ""China engine,"" regional development and future cooperation.  2023 will be a year full of uncertainties for Europe. Since the start of the Ukraine crisis, the European Union (EU) has shown ""solidarity"" with the United States out of security concerns and has imposed nine rounds of sanctions on Russia, which have backfired. In 2023, the wisdom of Europe will be tested whether it will continue to follow the United States and exert maximum pressure on Russia, or strengthen its strategic independence and seek to ease its confrontation with Moscow.   In 2023, Europe's energy crisis remains difficult to be eased. The energy crisis and high inflation will worsen its economic outlook. According to the European Commission, economic activity in the EU, the euro area and most member states is expected to keep contracting in the first quarter of 2023. Faced with many challenges, how to further promote China-EU relations has become more urgent for European countries in 2023. There is a sound foundation for the growth of China-EU relations: China remains the EU's largest trading partner, while the EU is China's second-largest trading partner. In addition, Chinese and EU leaders are in close communication, showing their willingness to jointly strengthen strategic communication and coordination to boost the China-EU comprehensive strategic partnership.  As U.S. politicians prepare for the 2024 presidential election in 2023, the partisan wrangling in the United States could be further polarized. Washington's adherence to the Cold War mentality in geopolitics and major-country relations may further disrupt the international order. Meanwhile, U.S. economic policies could have significant spillover effect on the world economy. There is widespread concern in the international community about the possibility of a recession in the United States.   Over the years, the United States has kept saying that it does not seek conflict or a new Cold War but doesn't walk its talk. In the Asia-Pacific, the United States has set up a ""quadrilateral mechanism"" with Japan, India and Australia, a trilateral security partnership AUKUS with Australia and Britain, and an ""Indo-Pacific Economic framework"" to ""decouple"" from China. In Europe, Washington has continuously inflamed the Ukraine crisis, which has not only worsened the security situation in Europe, but also affected international peace and security. If Washington continues to say one thing and do another in 2023, it will create new divisions and further disrupt the international order.  For countries in the region, the Ukraine crisis will still be the biggest pain point in 2023. Han Lu, deputy director of the Department for European-Central Asian Studies of the China Institute of International Studies, said the West will not give up the opportunity to suppress and weaken Russia and will do everything possible to continue its proxy war. The geopolitical uncertainty caused by the crisis may further increase.   Nevertheless, regional countries will not stop pursuing political stability, economic development and diplomatic breakthroughs. In the new year, although facing a volatile regional and international environment, they will continue to strengthen cooperation with China. China-Russia relations, based on non-alignment, non-confrontation and non-targeting of third parties, are rock-solid. China will work with countries in the region to strengthen the high-quality development of the Belt and Road through such projects as the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan Railway and the Line D of the Central Asia-China natural gas pipeline.  In 2023, the situation in the Middle East is likely to maintain a momentum of ""relaxing in general with instability in some parts."" Relations among regional countries are expected to keep improving despite uncertainties. In the meantime, Western powers are expected to tighten their grip on the region while speeding up adjusting their Middle East policies. Tang Zhichao, a scholar at the Institute of West-Asian and African Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the conciliatory atmosphere in the Middle East is sustainable. In 2023, there is great hope for continued peace and stability in the region. But uncertainties are also lying ahead, including whether there will be a breakthrough in negotiations to resume an implementation of the Iran nuclear deal.   With evolving regional political ecology and warming-up of China-Arab relations, the Middle East countries will move faster from ""looking eastward"" to ""heading eastward."" Tian Wenlin, professor at the School of International Relations at Renmin University of China, said amid great changes unseen in a century, Arab countries face historic opportunities to deepen their cooperation with China. It is foreseeable that in 2023, the relations between the Middle East countries and China will be further upgraded.  In 2022, many populous countries in Latin America, including Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina, have elected leftist governments. In 2023, the main question in Latin American politics is whether the leftists can consolidate their grip on power by strengthening unity and managing divisions. The challenge for Latin America's economy in 2023 is whether it can respond effectively to external shocks. In 2022, the U.S. Fed's aggressive interest rate hikes had exacerbated Latin American countries' debt burdens, pushing some into debt crises.   Zhou Mi, deputy director of the Institute of American and Oceanian Study at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation affiliated to the Ministry of Commerce, said that in 2023, Latin American countries need to determine policy direction as soon as possible to attract investment, guide industrial transformation, and strengthen regional economic coordination and integration. In recent years, Latin American integration has stalled. Following election wins, many leftist governments are attaching more importance to regional solidarity and diplomatic independence, injecting new impetus into Latin American integration.  In 2023, African countries will make further efforts to resolve conflicts, improve the security environment and achieve better economic performance. Li Hongfeng, dean of the School of African Studies at Beijing Foreign Studies University, said Africa's own capacity building is the most crucial part in solving the peace and security issues of the continent.   The African economy is still facing difficulties in the new year, but regional economic recovery is expected to pick up speed in 2023. Digital technology and green economy, among others, are expected to be new growth points for regional economy. In the new year, African countries will become more active on the international stage thanks to their huge development potential. From the United Nations Security Council reform to climate change and energy supply, Africa as a whole will play a bigger role in international affairs.",Xinhua,2023-01-06 17:31
664,"Democratic officials' homes, offices shot in U.S. state New Mexico","HOUSTON, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- Five local Democratic elected officials' homes or offices have been shot in a string of gunfire over the past month in Albuquerque, the largest city of southwestern U.S. state New Mexico. An investigation is underway. ""We're worried and concerned that these are connected and possibly politically motivated or personally motivated ... but we don't know that for a fact,"" Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller said at a press conference via the Albuquerque Police Department's Facebook livestream. During the shootings, multiple rounds have been fired into the doors and walls of these officials' homes or offices, in some cases while the officials were inside with their families. No one has been hurt. The FBI, together with the state and local police, are trying to determine if the attacks are connected. According to the Albuquerque Police Department, the first shooting occurred on Dec. 4, 2022, at the home of Bernalillo County Commissioner Adriann Barboa. Someone shot eight rounds at his house. On Dec. 10, ShotSpotter technology detected several gunshots in the area of New Mexico Attorney General Raul Torrez's former campaign office, where the attorney general had already moved out following his November election. One day later, the home of then Bernalillo Commissioner Debbie O'Malley came under fire. More than a dozen gunshot impacts were identified on walls and the house. Earlier this week, state Senator Linda Lopez's home was hit by at least eight shots after midnight. On Thursday morning, police responded a report of gun shots heard in the area of a downtown law office where state Senator Moe Maestas works.

U.S. Congressman Kevin McCarthy from California, the House Republican leader, fell short of the necessary votes to take the speaker gavel in 11 ballots over the past three days, making the contest the longest in 164 years. The House kicked off the 12th round of voting on Friday afternoon as the historic deadlock drags on, paralyzing the lower chamber three days after the new and divided 118th Congress convened. ""I'm not telling you we have an agreement,"" McCarthy reportedly said on Friday morning, adding that he and his opponents -- most of them conservative hardliners -- ""have meetings."" U.S. Congressman Chip Roy, a Texas Republican, is a leading opponent to McCarthy. His press office dismissed reports that a deal had been reached between the two sides on Friday morning. ""Any agreement will take us ALL,"" Roy's press aides tweeted. ""We are making progress... but don't let the sharks confuse the ongoing engagement."" Earlier in the day, House Democrats and -- reportedly only one Republican -- gathered on the steps of the Capitol, located at the eastern end of the National Mall in Washington, D.C., to mark the second anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack.

668,Travel agents in Tunisia expect Chinese tourists after China's optimization of COVID-19 response,"  TUNIS, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- China's latest COVID-19 response measures are warmly welcomed by hoteliers and travel agents in Tunisia, which are gearing up for the coming of Chinese guests. China has optimized its COVID-19 response, with restrictions on international flights to be lifted starting from Jan. 8. Amir Ben Aribia, general manager of the travel company Tunisia Blue Sky, told Xinhua that he is so happy to hear the good news, as Chinese customers contribute most of the company's business. Amir is a second-generation tourism practitioner whose father, a travel guide with years of experience, founded his own company, namely Tunisia Blue Sky, in 1996. The company started to receive Chinese tourists in 2013. Before the pandemic, roughly 90 percent of their clients came from China. ""The Chinese market is huge and growing fast. Chinese people travel all over the world,"" Amir said. Nowadays, China is not only the largest travel market worldwide but also one of the biggest spenders globally. At its peak in 2019, Chinese citizens made 155 million outbound trips. According to London-based The Economist, one in 10 international tourists was Chinese before the pandemic. ""Compared with Europeans, who prefer summer holidays at the seaside, Chinese show more interest in historical sites and natural landscapes, such as the ruins of ancient Carthage and the Sahara desert,"" Amir said, adding that this has brought them a significant and stable income. In 2017, Tunisia started to offer visa-free entry to Chinese tourists. Since then, China has emerged as one of Tunisia's fast-growing markets, with Chinese tourist arrivals rising from about 7,400 in 2016 to over 18,000 in 2017. ""Before visa exemptions, Chinese travelers rarely came to Tunisia. But now, more and more people flock to the North African country,"" Cai Feifei, Tunisia representative at SaishangTour, a travel services company headquartered in Beijing, told Xinhua. She said Chinese tourists especially enjoy spending the nights in tents in the Sahara desert. Bordering the Sahara desert and the Mediterranean Sea, Tunisia is renowned for its rich tourism resources. Tourism is a mainstay of Tunisia's economy. From 2015 to 2019, 7.2 million arrivals per year made it one of the most visited countries in Africa, according to WorldData. Internet statistics company Statista showed that tourism generated 10 percent of its gross domestic product in 2022. The COVID-19 pandemic had dealt a dramatic blow to the country's tourism industry. In 2020, revenues were down 62 percent to 1.01 billion dollars. For Amir, the worst time is over. He and his colleagues are preparing for the arrival of a new wave of Chinese travelers in 2023. ""As more Chinese tourists are expected to come, we do hope that there will be direct flights between China and Tunisia one day,"" he said.  ",Xinhua,2023-01-07 10:11
669,Asia-Pacific countries eager to welcome back Chinese tourists,"BANGKOK, Jan. 7 (Xinhua) -- China's recent optimization of its COVID-19 response and gradual restoration of Chinese citizens' overseas travel have enthused those working in the tourism sectors of Asia-Pacific countries. In the eyes of a Thai tuk-tuk driver who gave his name as Mak, the return of Chinese tourists means the revival of Thailand's economy. He hopes the hustle and bustle of foreign tourists on Bangkok's streets before the pandemic hit three years ago would soon come back.  In 2019, Thailand welcomed about 40 million foreign tourists, nearly 30 percent of whom were Chinese tourists. Thai Finance Minister Arkhom Termpittayapaisith said that China's gradual restoration of its citizens' overseas travel and other favorable factors could boost Thailand's tourism sector, Thailand's key economic growth contributor, pushing the Thai economy to grow 3.8 percent in 2023. Philippine President Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos Jr. invited the Chinese people to visit his country as tourists, students and investors. ""I shall push for the resumption of tourism and cultural cooperation between our two countries,"" he said. Indonesian Tourism and Creative Economy Minister Sandiaga Uno said the COVID-19 pandemic has had a huge negative impact on many sectors of Indonesia, including tourism. ""We lost almost 1 million plus job,"" he said, adding that cooperation with China is very important for the recovery of Indonesia's tourism sector. Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Techo Hun Sen said he was very pleased to welcome back Chinese tourists, saying that their presence is vital to the country's tourism and economic growth. ""When China reopens its borders, flights will increase many times, so we hope to welcome about 2 million Chinese tourists again (in 2023),"" Hun Sen said.  The tourism sectors of Asia-Pacific countries have been gearing up for the return of Chinese tourists in the new year. In New Zealand, some travel agencies have been communicating with their Chinese counterparts and customizing the latest tour itineraries for the coming Chinese tourists. Li Ruiqin, managing director of China Travel Service (NZ) Ltd., said Chinese tourists spend an average of 4,900 NZ dollars (about 3,064 U.S. dollars) per person when staying in New Zealand. The orderly resumption of outbound travel for Chinese tourists will be ""a major boon to New Zealand's tourism industry,"" she said. Travel specialist He Qingyuan in Australia said as the Chinese Lunar New Year is around the corner, he, along with his peers, is customizing exclusive tours for Chinese visitors. Yuthasak Supasorn, governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, said the tourism sector is gearing up for the return of Chinese tourists. Besides their favorite activities of visiting beaches and enjoying the food, ""we would like to promote exclusive tour packages in the northeast region, the less trampled corner of Thailand filled with natural beauty and authentic Thainess,"" he said. On the world-famous Boracay island in the central Philippines, the once-closed Chinese restaurants have been reopening one by one, and some local travel agencies have produced tour packages themed around the Chinese Lunar New Year, hoping to lure the first batch of Chinese tourists after the border reopens. Indonesia's ""paradise on Earth,"" Bali island, is no exception. Azril Azahari, chairman of the Indonesia Tourism Intellectual Association, said he expects an early arrival of Chinese tourists to Bali to enjoy the upgraded and diversified travel services.  China's recent announcement that it would downgrade the management of COVID-19 from Class A to Class B from Jan. 8 has been warmly welcomed by many countries, which have also called for rational pandemic prevention measures. Welcoming Chinese visitors, Hun Sen said China's upcoming reopening of its borders will revitalize Cambodia's economy and tourism, adding his country will not impose restrictions on Chinese tourists. In a statement on Wednesday, Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said Thailand has considered COVID-19 a communicable disease under surveillance. Foreign visitors entering Thailand from all parts of the world will be treated equally and no special public health measures will be implemented to discourage travelers from any particular country. Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Saw Swee Hoch School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore, said Singapore has a high vaccination rate and it is unnecessary for it to impose additional travel regulations on Chinese tourists.",Xinhua,2023-01-07 13:49
670,Thailand to benefit from China's optimized COVID-19 strategy: expert,"BANGKOK, Jan. 7 (Xinhua) -- China's optimized COVID-19 strategy will help boost Thailand's economic recovery amid a gloomy global economic outlook, a Thai expert said. The return of Chinese tourists will bolster the tourism industry and related businesses such as accommodation, transportation, food and beverage, and retail, Kevalin Wangpichayasuk, assistant managing director of Kasikorn Research Center, said in a recent written interview with Xinhua. It was estimated that in the pre-COVID-19 era, the consumption of Chinese tourists accounted for more than 3 percent of Thailand's nominal GDP, she added. The Thai government expects about 300,000 Chinese tourists to visit Thailand in the first three months of this year. It also sets a target of approximately 5 million Chinese tourists in 2023, equivalent to 45 percent of Chinese arrivals in 2019. Kevalin noted that she does not expect a major return of Chinese tourists until the second half of this year, or as soon as the second quarter of this year, due to visa processing time and gradual resumption of international flights, among others. In addition to tourism, increased economic activities with China are bound to promote trade and investment between the two countries, she said. ""We expect that Thai exports to China in 2023 would be better than other export markets and outperform the growth projection of total exports,"" she added.",Xinhua,2023-01-07 14:38

It was the first time a House speaker -- who maintains order, manages its proceedings, and governs the administration of its business on the lower chamber's floor -- had not been elected on the first ballot in 100 years. U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, said earlier this week that it is ""embarrassing for the country"" not to have a fully functional Congress, the legislature of the federal government.   All House Democrats voted for Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, making him the minority leader and the first African American lawmaker to run a party in either chamber of the U.S. Congress. To flip Republican holdouts, McCarthy reportedly made a series of concessions, including a lower threshold to force a vote on ousting the House speaker and a floor vote on a border security bill. He also promised that efforts to raise the nation's debt ceiling must be paired with spending cuts. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, also a New York Democrat, responded to the alleged concessions after McCarthy's election, saying the proposals ""will cause a government shutdown or a default with devastating consequences to our country."" ""Speaker Kevin McCarthy's dream job could turn into a nightmare for the American people,"" Schumer said. ""To get the votes, he surrendered to demands of a fringe element of the Republican party.""

Two years ago, a large group of supporters of outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump violently stormed the Capitol and disrupted a joint session of Congress to affirm the results of the 2020 presidential election in which Biden won.

At a ceremony in the White House on Friday, Biden warned that things like the Capitol riot ""could happen again"" as the United States faces ""an inflection point"" in its history. Two years after the riot, U.S. democracy ""is in distress and the House is a total mess,"" said Brad Bannon, a Democratic pollster and CEO of Bannon Communications Research.

In terms of healthcare, Ahmad said, China increased its capacity to treat COVID-19 patients rapidly, adding that it had also developed and approved several vaccines, which have been used to immunize large portions of people at home and across the world. The health scientist noted that China's efforts to contain the spread of the virus had been widely acknowledged by the international community. Highlighting the recent optimization of China's pandemic response measures, Ahmad said that countries must be flexible and adaptable in their approach to preventing and controlling the spread of COVID-19. There are many factors that can influence the epidemic prevention policies, such as the prevalence of the virus in a given area, the capacity of the healthcare system to cope with new cases, and the potential impact on the economy and society, he said.

He said that China kept adopting a scientific approach against the virus since the beginning of the outbreak while employing strong economic fundamentals and measures to stimulate demand. Ahmad noted that China has made significant efforts to support its economy and mitigate the impact of the pandemic on society, and its response actions to COVID-19 have also had a positive impact on the global economy.

The democratic model of the United States ""is outdated and worn out because it now generates violence and intolerance, with assaults on institutions,"" Huanacuni told Xinhua on Friday. The U.S. democratic model is in decline now as it has not adapted to the current global reality and the changes that are taking place in the political, social, and economic spheres, said the Bolivian politician. On Jan. 6, 2021, supporters of outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump violently stormed the Capitol in Washington, D.C., disrupting a joint session of Congress to affirm the results of the 2020 presidential election in which Joe Biden won. According to the Department of Justice, more than 900 people were arrested for crimes related to the destruction of the Capitol. And in recent days, there was also an unprecedented lack of consensus over the election of the speaker of the House of Representatives, who failed to be chosen with 14 ballots. These two events show the fragility of U.S. institutions, which need to adjust to the current times, said Huanacuni. On the future of democracy in the country, the former foreign minister said that there needs to be a new social pact, and the relaunching of a process of democratic change based on the new reality. ""The global political scenario is changing. The axis of the new political order must be a democracy that characterizes and stimulates the needs of the people,"" he said. If changes are not made, he said, the United States is destined for failure, fragmentation, and the deepening of democratic decadence.

However, since the outbreak of the pandemic, the number has drastically dropped, with only 94,924 Chinese tourists coming to Indonesia during January-October 2022. This year, Uno said, Indonesia expects at least 253,000 Chinese tourists to visit the country.",Xinhua,2023-01-10 10:13
647,Indian capital puts curbs on vehicles amid severe air pollution,"NEW DELHI, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- The air pollution level in the Indian capital territory New Delhi on Monday became severe, prompting local authorities to put curbs on some vehicles until Friday, local media reported. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the overall air quality index (AQI) turned severe at 444. ""The AQI in Delhi at 8:00 p.m. (local time) today was recorded at 444,"" data released by CPCB said. ""The air quality is very poor and prominent pollutants are PM 2.5 and PM 10."" Experts say PM 2.5 are fine particles that are 2.5 microns or less in diameter and can travel deep into the respiratory tract, reaching the lungs and entering the bloodstream. Meanwhile, the local government in view of the worsening air quality in Delhi has decided to impose a temporary ban on plying of BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles in the national capital from Tuesday. The BS is the short form of Bharat Stage, a government-instituted emission standard for four-wheelers. Keeping in view the severe category of Delhi's AQI, health experts have advised residents to stop outdoor activity in the early morning and after sunset times, besides avoiding prolonged or heavy exertion. As per CPCB, AQI between 0 - 50 is considered ""good"", between 51 - 100 ""satisfactory"", between 101 - 200 ""moderate"", between 201 - 300 ""poor"", between 301 - 400 ""very poor"", and between 401 - 500 ""severe"" and beyond 500 is severe plus emergency. Air pollution continues to worsen in New Delhi and it gets aggravated during winter months.

648,COVID restrictions on Chinese travelers unnecessary: Danish health authorities,"   COPENHAGEN, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- Restrictions on Chinese travelers entering Denmark are unnecessary, the Danish Health Ministry said on Monday. ""There is no binding requirement for testing before entering Denmark from China,"" the Ministry said following an assessment of potential COVID-19 measures. To help prevent infection, free antigen testing is being offered to those arriving in Denmark on direct flights from China.   The Danish Epidemic Commission said on Monday that there is currently ""no significant risk of COVID-19 spreading from China to Denmark, or significant risk of the introduction of new virus variants, as there is high population immunity in Denmark."" An earlier assessment by the Statens Serum Institut (SSI), the Danish national center for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, came to the same conclusion.

650,Iranian speaker holds Trump legally accountable for killing top commander,"  TEHRAN, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian parliament speaker said on Monday that former U.S. President Donald Trump and all his ""accomplices"" must be held legally accountable for the assassination of top Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani, semi-official Tasnim News Agency reported. The ""criminal act"" of assassinating Soleimani was a ""flagrant and absolute instance of state terrorism,"" Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf told the 13th session of the Asian Parliamentary Assembly in Türkiye's capital Ankara. Qalibaf stressed that Soleimani dedicated his entire life to regional and international peace and implemented effective measures in fighting international terrorism.   On Jan. 3, 2020, the U.S. military, at the order of Trump, assassinated Soleimani and the deputy commander of Iraq's paramilitary Hashd Shaabi forces Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis near Baghdad International Airport.

652,China calls for full implementation of resolution on cross-border aid deliveries into Syria,"   UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese envoy on Monday called for efforts to ensure the full and effective implementation of the Security Council resolution on cross-border aid deliveries into Syria. The Security Council on Monday adopted Resolution 2672 to confirm the re-authorization of the cross-border mechanism for another six months, till July 10, 2023. China hopes that the Security Council and relevant UN agencies will seize the opportunity of the extension to comprehensively sum up the experience and shortcomings in the implementation of Resolution 2642 in the past six months, so as to ensure the full and effective implementation of Resolution 2672 and make greater contributions to continuously improving the humanitarian situation of all Syrians, said Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the United Nations. The sovereignty of Syria and the ownership of the Syrian government must be fully respected, he said. ""Cross-border assistance is a temporary arrangement made under special circumstances, and should ultimately transition, in an orderly manner, to cross-line assistance, so that the latter will become the main channel for humanitarian assistance to Syria,"" he said in an explanation of vote. To this end, the frequency and the size of convoys of cross-line assistance in Northwest Syria must be significantly increased, and cross-line assistance to the Rukban refugee camp on the border with Jordan should resume as early as possible, he said. All parties should ensure adequate supplies and funding for cross-line assistance and step up coordination with relevant parties, in particular the parties in de facto control of Northwest Syria, so as to effectively improve the access environment for cross-line assistance, he added. Vigorous efforts must be made for quality and efficiency gains in early-recovery projects, said Zhang. At present, the overall funding for early-recovery projects needs to be improved. Early-recovery projects in different sectors are seeing mixed progress, and there are major differences in project implementation among different regions. China urges all donors to put the well-being of all Syrians first and promptly and properly resolve these problems, he said. The removal of explosive remnants of war is important for restoring the normal work and life of the Syrian people, and should be included in the scope of early recovery as quickly as possible, he said. Unilateral sanctions impede humanitarian access in Syria and restrict its access to humanitarian resources, running counter to the humanitarian efforts by the Security Council and the international community. China once again urges the relevant countries to immediately and fully lift the unilateral sanctions on Syria, said Zhang.",Xinhua,2023-01-10 11:02
651,U.S. House adopts rules package after dysfunctional opening week,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of Representatives adopted a rules package on Monday after the dysfunctional opening week. The package, which will govern how the House led by Republicans operates for the next two years, was passed in a 220-213 vote, mainly along party lines. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy -- whose bid to take the gavel last week paralyzed the lower chamber for days -- said on Monday evening that ""Congress has been broken for a long time."" McCarthy, a California Republican, made multiple concessions to House Republican hardliners in order to rise to the post, including a measure to allow a single member to call for a vote to remove the speaker. Republicans flipped the House in the 2022 midterm elections while Democrats held onto their majority in the Senate. The new, divided Congress convened early last week, but McCarthy didn't secure enough votes to become House speaker until the 15th ballot due to intra-party division and partisanship. The longest House speaker election contest in 164 years prevented Congress from being fully operational.",Xinhua,2023-01-10 13:14
653,World welcomes China's resumption of outbound tourism,"  China has resumed outbound tourism after downgrading COVID-19 management measures from Class A to B starting on Sunday. The global tourism market has responded warmly to this change and actively welcomed Chinese tourists. According to Ctrip data, as of Jan 5, overseas travel orders for the seven days during Spring Festival had surged by 540 percent and the average order cost had increased by 32 percent over the same period last year. It is expected that overseas tourist destinations will welcome a large number of Chinese tourists during the holiday. Industry experts predict China's move will boost the development of global tourism and stimulate economic recovery, as well as promote people-to-people exchanges.  According to United Nations World Tourism Organization, China was one of the world's major outbound tourism contributors before the outbreak of the pandemic. The optimized COVID-19 policy will have a positive impact on the development of tourism in China as well as the world. Steve Saxon, who leads McKinsey's Travel, Logistics &Infrastructure Practice in China, said China averaged about 12 million outbound air passengers per month in 2019, and predicts that figure will recover to about 6 million per month by the summer.   Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Techo Hun Sen said that China's upcoming reopening of its borders will revitalize the kingdom's economy and tourism. ""When China reopens its borders, flights will increase many times, so we hope to welcome about 2 million Chinese tourists again (in 2023),"" Hun Sen said. He added that the Southeast Asian nation is very pleased to welcome the return of Chinese tourists, saying that their presence is vital to the country's tourism and economic growth. Saudi Arabia's Tourism Minister Ahmed Al-Khateeb said that he hopes more Chinese tourists would visit and learn about Saudi heritage, culture, and people.   ""China is one of Saudi Arabia's main trade partners, and we have been enjoying Chinese culture and heritage for many years, especially the delicious food that can be found everywhere in Saudi Arabia. Now, we want the Chinese to come,"" the minister said. Shop owners in Khan el-Khalili, one of the most famed tourist bazaars in the Egyptian capital Cairo, are expecting the return of Chinese tourists after China opened up its borders beginning Sunday. ""Before the spread of COVID-19, the business was good as large numbers of tourists, especially Chinese, flocked here,"" said Amr Dahi, who sells precious stones and copper artifacts in the centuries-old market. Mohammed Saleh, owner of a traditional Egyptian restaurant in Khan el-Khalili, said Chinese people are very friendly.   ""We are so happy to hear the good news,"" said Amir Ben Aribia, general manager of the Tunisian travel company Tunisia Blue Sky. With Chinese tourists accounting for 90 percent of the company's business before the pandemic outbreak, Ben Aribia has been closely following the adjustment of China's COVID-related policies. The orderly resumption of outbound travel for Chinese tourists will be ""a major boon to New Zealand's tourism industry,"" said Lisa Li, managing director of New Zealand's largest travel agency. About 1,000 Chinese tourists arrived in New Zealand in the week early last month, a significant increase from three months earlier, according to the country's statistics agency Stats NZ.   Tourism Minister Stuart Nash said about 150,000 Chinese tourists were expected to visit New Zealand in 2023. ""Our regions have already seen a boost in tourism spending and this looks set to continue in the summer months.""  Thailand on Monday welcomed the arrival of thousands of Chinese tourists in its capital of Bangkok, the first group following China's optimization of COVID-19 strategy which took effect on Jan 8. At the Suvarnabhumi Airport, Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul and other senior officials welcomed 269 tourists from the Chinese city of Xiamen, who were greeted with flowers and gift bags. Thailand tourism sector has recently estimated that about 300,000 Chinese tourists will come to Thailand in the first quarter of this year.   Etihad Airways is set to strengthen air connectivity between the UAE and China. ""Etihad Airways is delighted to add a second weekly passenger service to Shanghai following the further relaxation of COVID-related travel measures,"" said Martin Drew, senior vice-president of Global Sales &Cargo at Etihad Aviation Group. Combined with a weekly service to Beijing and a twice-weekly service to Guangzhou, this will provide travelers with five weekly nonstop flights between Abu Dhabi and China. Chairman of the Vietnam Tourism Association Vu The Binh said the first thing the tourism sector should do is to take immediate measures to improve the quality of services to attract Chinese tourists. President of the Vietnam Travel Association's Union Cao Tri Dung said it is important to resume the regular flight and charter flight networks, and strengthen the promotion of destinations in localities that have direct flights from China or are close to China in proximity. Vietnamese airlines are permitted to resume regular flights to China like in the pre-COVID-19 period.   Pakistan is not just looking at inviting Chinese tourists to Pakistan, but also looking at sending Pakistani tourists to China, said Aftab ur-Rehman Rana, the managing director of Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation. The decision to hold the Pakistan-China Year of Tourism Exchanges in 2023 will greatly help improve people-to-people contacts and especially promote tourism cooperation, he added. ""For Pakistan, the opening of Chinese tourism is a very positive sign,"" Rana said, adding that Pakistan has made a lot of preparation to welcome Chinese tourists. The government has been working on improving the availability of information on both sides as well as producing new literature on major tourist destinations in the Chinese language, so that the Chinese tourists know well about Pakistan, he said. Rosemary Anderson, the national chair of hospitality industry body, Federated Hospitality Association of South Africa, said there are ways in which SA can make itself a more attractive destination for Chinese tourists such as offering payment platforms, like WeChat Pay and Alipay, being aware of when Chinese holidays take place, learning key phrases in Mandarin, and training tourist guides to speak Mandarin.",Chinadaily.com.cn,2023-01-10 13:53
654,Classified documents found at Biden think tank,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- A special counsel to U.S. President Joe Biden said on Monday that classified documents had been found at a private office here used while he was vice president. White House special counsel Richard Sauber said the documents were discovered ""when Biden's attorneys were packing files housed in a locked closet to prepare to vacate office space at the Penn Biden Center in Washington, D.C."" The Penn Biden Center is a think tank not far from the White House, affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania and named for Biden. Sauber said Biden, a Democrat, periodically used this space from mid-2017 until the start of his 2020 presidential campaign. The discovery of ""what appears to be Obama-Biden Administration records, including a small number of documents with classified markings"" was made on Nov. 2, 2022. On that day, the White House Counsel's office notified the National Archives, which took possession of the materials the following morning, said Sauber. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland reportedly tasked the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois John Lausch Jr. with reviewing the matter. The U.S. Department of Justice is also investigating former President Donald Trump's handling of a trove of classified documents seized from his estate in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, by federal agents in the summer of 2022. Trump, a Republican, responded to the news of classified documents found at the Penn Biden Center, posting Monday on social media that ""when is the FBI going to raid the many homes of Joe Biden, perhaps even the White House?""

675,"Man in custody over shootings at New Mexico Democratic officials' homes, offices","HOUSTON, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- A man is in custody due to possible links with at least one shooting at the homes or offices of Democratic elected officials in Albuquerque, the largest city in the southwestern U.S. state New Mexico, authorities said Monday. The unidentified suspect, who is said to be under 50, has not been formally charged in any of the cases, the Albuquerque Police Department (APD) said. The APD has recovered a firearm that was linked to one of the shootings, APD Chief Harold Medina said at a brief news conference. ""We are trying to still link and see which cases are related and which are not related,"" said Medina. ""So until we get more details and we finish the process of seeing where the evidence leads up and getting returns on our warrants, this will be the extent of our information."" Earlier on Monday, the APD reported that investigators are looking into a sixth shooting which happened in early December at the home of incoming New Mexico House Speaker, Democratic Representative Javier Martinez. Including Martinez, six Democratic elected officials' homes or offices were shot at in December 2022 and January 2023. It remains unclear if the shootings are all connected, though police say they've found ""potential connections between some of the shootings."" However, Medina said it was ""too early"" to talk about motives behind the shootings, which were all directed towards homes or offices of Democratic officials. During the shootings, multiple rounds have been fired into the doors and walls of the officials' homes or offices, in some cases while the officials were inside with their families. No one has been hurt. According to the APD, the first shooting occurred on Dec. 4, 2022, at the home of Bernalillo County Commissioner Adriann Barboa. Someone shot eight rounds at his house. On Dec. 10, ShotSpotter technology detected several gunshots in the area of New Mexico Attorney General Raul Torrez's former campaign office, where the attorney general had already moved out following his November election. One day later, the home of then Bernalillo Commissioner Debbie O'Malley came under fire. More than a dozen gunshot impacts were identified on walls and the house. Last week, state Senator Linda Lopez's home was hit by at least eight shots after midnight, and the police department's ShotSpotter system registered three shots fired at a downtown law office where state Senator Moe Maestas works. The shootings occurred nearly two years after a large group of supporters of then U.S. President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021, and disrupted a joint session of Congress to affirm the 2020 presidential election results.",Xinhua,2023-01-10 16:41

According to Rugaju, the residents have been complaining about stray animals destroying their crops despite the government promising to put a fence around the park. ""The residents have since threatened to kill wild animals when they are sighted in their gardens since the Uganda Wildlife Authority rangers have failed in their duty to drive the animals back to the park whenever they attack,"" Rugaju added.

738,Feature: Avian flu hits U.S. West from wilderness to grocery,"  DENVER, the United States, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- Egg shortages and skyrocketing prices at grocery stores continue to impact American consumers as a result of the historic avian flu that is spreading rapidly among wild birds and has triggered the killing of millions of poultry. ""We have never seen anything like the enormity of this outbreak,"" Michael Tincher with the Rocky Mountain Raptor Program (RMRP) told The Colorado Sun newspaper on Monday. RMRP is a group of a dozen scientists who work toward protecting and saving wild birds of prey. Colorado's worst-ever avian flu outbreak has now resulted in nearly 6.4 million poultry deaths and is increasingly crossing over into wild birds and killing bald eagles and other precious raptors, the newspaper reported, adding ""wildlife watchers call the event 'the stuff of bad dreams.'"" Last week, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) defined on its website the recent bird flu as Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) and warned poultry producers that ""wild birds can be infected and show no signs of illness. They can carry the disease to new areas when migrating, potentially exposing domestic poultry to the virus."" HPAI has been detected in all 50 U.S. states, with Colorado, Utah, North Dakota, Oregon and California in the top 10 states having confirmed deaths of wild birds, although Florida, with its abundant coastline and waterfowl, leads the country in bird deaths with 379, according to USDA data. Hundreds of wild bird deaths may not sound like many, but experts said the numbers being reported are ""just a small fraction"" of birds dying in the wild. ""Wildlife officials say they are overwhelmed by reports of carcasses in the wild and have limited testing of dead birds in order to concentrate efforts in the most impacted areas,"" the newspaper said. Calling the current global avian outbreak ""the Covid of Bird Flus,"" Tincher told Xinhua that initial keys toward combating the plague are education and awareness, and ""not about creating a panic."" ""When Covid hit, we didn't know anything about it, so we need to be patient,"" he said. ""We need to play the long game and see how it carries out."" Wild birds affected by the virus cover the gamut of wild water fowl from the White Pelican in the south to the Snow Goose in the North, and include the Red-Tailed Hawk, the Mallard, and the Bald Eagle, the legendary symbol of America's heritage. Last month, Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) officials were dismayed that the current blight had killed a tagged and tracked Bald Eagle, one of the state's ""resurgent but still tenuous population of nesting bald eagles totaling 250 to 300 pairs statewide,"" CBS Colorado reported. ""It's definitely somewhat demoralizing, especially to be losing these numbers of birds and in so many locations,"" CPW researcher Reesa Conrey told the media. Meanwhile, local markets across the West are suffering from the bird flu pandemic. ""The mass slaughter of egg-laying flocks has decimated the commercial egg market in the state,"" The Colorado Sun added, adding every major egg producer in Colorado has been hit hard since the outbreak escalated again last month. ""Consumers don't realize that this hike in egg prices is not due to inflation, but due to worst avian flu outbreak on record,"" Tincher said, noting that the ""Highly Pathogenic"" classification of the illness sets it aside from all others, ever. Egg prices doubled in 2022, according to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and thus far 2023, consumers are facing more egg hikes. ""Ten Dollars for a dozen eggs, that's absolutely ridiculous,"" Erma Rouse, a Circle K employee in North Denver, told Xinhua on Tuesday, whose small convenience store had no eggs for sale on that day. Rouse was aware that the avian outbreak has caused egg shortages and price jumps, telling Xinhua that she ""won't eat them again until the price drops."" ""We get calls from people who tell us a nearby raptor or eagle is acting funny or dying, and the first question we ask them is if they have any poultry nearby,"" Tincher told Xinhua. Many poultry farmers who live in rural areas are not fully aware that the ongoing avian outbreak, which has been ebbing and increasing in severity for almost a year, is possibly being spread more by wild birds carrying the disease. Not only Colorado's major producers have to destroy flocks of egg-laying chickens, thousands of small chicken operators and citizens who eat their own eggs or sell them in small quantities are also feeling the pinch. Last March, a commercial flock of 2.75 million chickens in Wisconsin ""had to be culled,"" Reuters reported, and in April, ""U.S. egg factory roasts 5.3 million chickens in avian flu cull,"" The Guardian's headline read. The San Francisco Chronicle reported Tuesday that ""bay area restaurants are paying double for eggs as avian flu clutches supply."" ""An avian flu outbreak that has choked egg supply and faced grocery store shoppers in California and across the country with empty shelves and high prices has also hit restaurants,"" the article noted. Bay Area restaurant operators ""now pay more than 100 U.S. dollars per case and that producer prices for eggs were up more than 280 percent in one year as of November,"" the report said, using the most recent months for which the Bureau of Labor Statistics data was available.",Xinhua,2023-01-11 09:53

In a statement released on Monday, NSW Maritime said that during the two-day Operation Ride Smart campaign, officers checked nearly 2,200 recreational vessels, including jetskis, which resulted in a total of 78 fines and 236 official warnings. ""Since the start of the boating season on Oct. 1, 2022, across NSW we've recorded more than 120 incidents including a boat fire, boats capsizing, collisions and multiple water rescues where serious injuries were reported. Tragically, there have also been four boating-related fatalities,"" said NSW Maritime Acting Executive Director Hendrik Clasie. ""Jetskis are heavily overrepresented in serious boating incidents and complaints,"" Clasie said, noting that the top three offenses over the weekend were unlicensed operation of a jetski, irregular riding, and not cooperating with compliance checks. ""We love to see locals and holidaymakers enjoying our state's waterways, but people need to be aware they are in a different condition following months of severe rainfall and flooding. We're seeing more debris and unseen hazards, including entire trees,"" said the director. He called on watercraft users to remember care, courtesy and common sense, especially when there are swimmers, surfers or paddle boarders around. According to the NSW Maritime, there are currently more than 82,000 licensed riders in the state, with nearly 20,000 personal watercrafts registered.",Xinhua,2023-01-11 09:57

The accident happened on Tuesday morning between a passenger car and two trucks on the road from Neyshabur to Firuzeh, causing five passengers killed, Abolfazl Rafiee, the head of the Red Crescent Relief and Rescue Committee of Khorasan Razavi province, told ISNA. He said that the cause of the accident was non-observance of the longitudinal distance and slippery road surface. Rafiee also blamed disregard for the secure distance between cars, as well as slippery icy road surfaces in extreme weather conditions in winter for the imbalance of cars and reported accidents.",Xinhua,2023-01-11 10:01
623,"WHO official urges science-based, non-discriminatory COVID entry restrictions","   COPENHAGEN, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the World Health Organization (WHO) has urged countries to take science-based precautionary COVID-19 entry restrictions that are proportionate and non-discriminatory. Hans Kluge, WHO's regional director for Europe, made the appeal at a press conference here on Tuesday. ""For those countries in our region introducing precautionary travel measures at this time, we are calling for such to be rooted in science, to be proportionate and non-discriminatory,"" Kluge said.   ""Scientifically, there is no immediate threat for the European region at this point in time based on the information we have from China, because the (virus) variants that are circulating in China are also circulating in Europe,"" Kluge told Xinhua. ""We share the current view of the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) that the ongoing surge in China is not anticipated to significantly impact the COVID-19 epidemiological situation in the WHO European Region at this time,"" he said. Kluge reiterated the importance of scientific surveillance and criticized certain countries in the region for having significantly reduced their surveillance capacity for COVID-19 detection.   According to Kluge, it might be risky to ignore other significant aspects of the evolution of the virus, such as the Omicron XBB.1.5 recombinant variant, which has rapidly spread throughout the United States and is currently expanding in the European region. Kluge called on countries to take on even more responsibility, including increasing vaccine uptake in general populations, providing additional vaccine doses to priority groups, promoting mask-wearing both indoors and on public transportation, ventilating crowded and public spaces, and providing early and appropriate treatment to patients at risk of severe diseases.",Xinhua,2023-01-11 10:07
624,"NATO, EU sign declaration on cooperation","BRUSSELS, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU) signed a third Joint Declaration on cooperation Tuesday that aimed to further expand their strategic partnership collaboration and strengthen collective European defense. ""We have just signed the third EU-NATO joint declaration ... This is more important than ever,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told a news conference following the signing ceremony at the military alliance's headquarters in Brussels. The declaration was signed by European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who lauded the agreement, saying it would deepen the existing cooperation between the Union and the alliance. According to the joint declaration, EU and NATO will expand and deepen cooperation in such areas as geostrategic competition, resilience, critical infrastructure protection, emerging and disruptive technologies, and space. Von der Leyen said that Europe's security was ""challenged"" and ""under threat"" by the conflict in Ukraine. Stoltenberg highlighted the importance of the declaration, stressing the crucial role of NATO in Euro-Atlantic security. He noted that this declaration built upon two previous joint declarations signed in 2016 and 2018. Stoltenberg touched upon the prospect of Finland and Sweden joining NATO, stating that this would result in the alliance protecting 96 percent of EU citizens.",Xinhua,2023-01-11 10:24
625,UK gov't introduces laws to mitigate disruption of strikes on public,"LONDON, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom (UK) government on Tuesday introduced new laws that would enable it to set minimum levels of service during strikes to ensure the safety of the public and their access to public services. In a bid to mitigate the disruptions caused by strikes, the bill would ensure that crucial public services, such as rail, ambulances and fire services, maintain a minimum service during industrial action, ""reducing risk to life and ensuring the public can still get to work,"" a government statement said. ""The first job of any government is to keep the public safe. Because whilst we absolutely believe in the ability to strike, we are duty-bound to protect the lives and livelihoods of the British people,"" Business Secretary Grant Shapps said in the statement. The UK has been in the grip of a wave of strikes, which started in summer 2022 and continued into this year, as inflation has stayed consistently high and pay rises failed to keep up. Rail workers and nurses were among those who staged the action. The government locked horns with the trade unions. It said the pay rises that unions had called for were unaffordable and higher pay would not help fight inflation. On Monday, government ministers and unions met, but the talks once again failed to change course. The unions criticized the new legislation on Tuesday. This bill was ""another dangerous gimmick"" from a government that should be negotiating to resolve the current crisis, said General Secretary Sharon Graham of Unite, one of the largest trade unions in the UK. ""Evidence from abroad clearly shows this kind of legislation only forces unions to use other tactics, inflaming and prolonging disputes,"" Graham added.",Xinhua,2023-01-11 10:28

629,South Africa not to impose travel restrictions for other countries,"JOHANNESBURG, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- South African Health Minister Joe Phaahla said Tuesday that there is no need to impose restrictions for other countries with high COVID-19 infections following the detection of the Omicron XBB.1.5 variant in his country. ""We were not imposing any restrictions or travel requirements for China, the United States or any country with rising infections,"" said Phaahla when briefing the media virtually about COVID-19. A patient with the XBB.1.5 variant was discovered on Dec. 27 during a random sampling and further details remain unknown, he said. The minister said they have engaged scientists, the World Health Organization and the ministerial advisory committee, who suggested that there is no need to impose travel restrictions internally or for any country. ""We were advised to increase surveillance and vaccination. We will do wastewater testing on aircraft from China, the United States or any country with rising infections to check for the virus. We will step up our communication and messaging for people to get vaccinated or a booster,"" he said.

632,1 child or youth died every 4.4 seconds in 2021: UN report,"  UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 5 million children died before their fifth birthday and another 2.1 million children and youth aged between 5 and 24 years lost their lives in 2021, according to the latest estimates released by the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation on Tuesday. In a separate report also released on Tuesday, the group found that 1.9 million babies were stillborn during the same period. ""Every day, far too many parents are facing the trauma of losing their children, sometimes even before their first breath,"" said Vidhya Ganesh, UN Children's Fund director of the Division of Data Analytics, Planning and Monitoring, in a press release. ""Such widespread, preventable tragedy should never be accepted as inevitable. Progress is possible with stronger political will and targeted investment in equitable access to primary health care for every woman and child."" The reports show some positive outcomes with a lower risk of death across all ages globally since 2000. The global under-5 mortality rate fell by half since the start of the century, while mortality rates in older children and youth dropped by 36 percent, and the stillbirth rate decreased by 35 percent. This can be attributed to more investments in strengthening primary health systems to benefit women, children and young people. However, gains have reduced significantly since 2010, and 54 countries will fall short of meeting the Sustainable Development Goals target for under-5 mortality. Unless swift action is taken to improve health services, almost 59 million children and youth will die before 2030, and nearly 16 million babies will be lost to stillbirth, warn the agencies. Children continue to face wildly differentiating chances of survival based on where they are born, with sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia shouldering the heaviest burden, the reports show. Though sub-Saharan Africa had just 29 percent of global live births, the region accounted for 56 percent of all under-5 deaths in 2021, and Southern Asia for 26 percent of the total. Children born in sub-Saharan Africa are subject to the highest risk of childhood death in the world -- 15 times higher than the risk for children in Europe and Northern America. Mothers in these two regions also endure the painful loss of babies to stillbirth at an exceptional rate, with 77 percent of all stillbirths in 2021 occurring in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Nearly half of all stillbirths happened in sub-Saharan Africa. The risk of a woman having a stillborn baby in sub-Saharan Africa is seven times more likely than in Europe and North America, the reports show. Access to and availability of quality health care continues to be a matter of life or death for children globally. Most child deaths occur in the first five years, of which half are within the very first month of life. For those youngest babies, premature birth and complications during labor are the leading causes of death. Similarly, more than 40 percent of stillbirths occur during labor, most of which are preventable when women have access to quality care throughout pregnancy and birth. For children that survive past their first 28 days, infectious diseases like pneumonia, diarrhea and malaria pose the biggest threat, according to the reports. While COVID-19 has not directly increased childhood mortality, with children facing a lower likelihood of dying from the disease than adults, the pandemic may have increased future risks to their survival. In particular, the reports highlight concerns around disruptions to vaccination campaigns, nutrition services, and access to primary health care, which could jeopardize their health and well-being for many years to come. In addition, the pandemic has fuelled the largest continued backslide in vaccinations in three decades, putting the most vulnerable newborns and children at greater risk of dying from preventable diseases.",Xinhua,2023-01-11 10:43
633,Ukraine's foodstuff exports reach 17 mln tons under grain deal,"KIEV, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's foodstuff exports reached 17 million metric tons since August under a deal on the export of grain and fertilizers from Black Sea ports, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reported Tuesday. In the past three days, five vessels loaded with 158,500 metric tons of agricultural products departed from Ukraine's ports for Egypt, Sri Lanka and other countries, the agency said, citing the Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority. Currently, 98 ships are waiting for inspection in the Bosphorus, with 21 of them already loaded and 77 heading for loading. On July 22, Russia and Ukraine separately signed a document in Istanbul with Türkiye and the United Nations on grain and fertilizer exports from Ukraine and Russia to ensure supplies to global markets amid the Russia-Ukraine armed conflict.

628,Nurse shortage betrays fractured U.S. medical system,"  NEW YORK, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of nurses and their supporters lined both sides of Madison Avenue in front of Mount Sinai Hospital on Monday, waving signs, blowing horns and calling for a labor contract that will require more nurses at the bedside for patients. The nurses, members of the New York State Nurses Association, went on strike after talks with Mount Sinai Hospital management broke down in the early morning hours. Strikes also unfolded at the three campuses of the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx over similar issues of pay and staffing. ""Monday's labor action, involving more than 7,000 nurses, represented the largest nursing strike in decades in New York City,"" said The New York Times (NYT), noting that nurses are increasingly turning toward walkouts as a labor strategy, both nationally and abroad. ""Nurses, who both saw how valued they were during the darkest days of the COVID-19 pandemic, and who struggled with exhaustion and burnout, said they were standing their ground to improve conditions both for themselves and their patients,"" it added.    In an opinion article published one year earlier by NYT, ""We Know the Real Cause of the Crisis in Our Hospitals. It's Greed,"" the author said that as the third year of COVID-19 started, America's nurses -- who people celebrated as heroes during the early days of lockdown -- were now leaving the bedside. ""Nurses set the record straight about the root cause of the nursing crisis: chronic understaffing by profit-driven hospitals that predates the pandemic,"" it said, quoting one nurse as saying that ""I could no longer work in critical care under the conditions I was being forced to work under with poor staffing."" ""Fueled by factors like employee burnout, an aging population and a dearth of training, states across the country are facing a familiar and common problem: a nursing shortage,"" U.S. News and World Report once noted, saying that even before the COVID-19 pandemic began to unfold at the start of 2020, a gap existed between the supply and the demand through 2030. Once the COVID-19 crisis hit, health care positions were not isolated from sudden job losses, which helped widen the gap between projected demand and the actual number of registered nurses in the United States, it added.  A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) study projected that the demand for registered nurses would hit more than 3.6 million by year 2030. On top of the existing workforce, the field would have needed to add nearly 50,000 new registered nurses each year since 2014 to meet that demand. ""The shortage may worsen in part due to who exactly is leaving the profession,"" said U.S. News and World Report. Since 2016, registered nurses 25 to 34 years old have accounted for the highest share of the profession by age group. But between May 2020 and May 2021, the number of nurses in that age group declined 5.2 percent. Meanwhile, those 35 to 44 years old, who make up the second highest share of nurses, saw their numbers decline at an even higher rate of 7.4 percent. The number of registered nurses 65 and older hit its highest level yet in data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that dates back to 2011. Pandemic job losses in health care as a whole impacted women much more than men. In January 2020, women held over 13 million jobs in the U.S. health care industry, compared with the 3 million held by men. By April of that year, women had lost 10.6 percent, or 1.38 million, of those positions, as men lost 5.5 percent of theirs.    Amid the pandemic, ""health leaders say nurses are bone-tired and frustrated from being asked to work overtime, from getting screamed at and second-guessed by members of the community, and from dealing with people who chose not to get vaccinated or wear a mask,"" NBC has reported. As Omicron cases surged, U.S. nurses had been stretched to their limits for months under extreme physical and emotional burden and facing immense burnout. ""Many nurses are left to silently suffer as they face overwhelming feelings of exhaustion, irritability, anxiety and sadness that are chipping away daily at our mental health,"" said Lauren Ghazal, a board-certified family nurse practitioner in New York and a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Michigan. As the American workforce was then undergoing a rapid transformation as part of the ""Great Resignation,"" more nurses turned toward options like travel nursing -- short-term employment contracts in hospitals and regions that were in dire need of them and offered more money than the salary of local staff nurses, the report said.  To keep patients safe and protect health care workers, lawmakers came up with an idea of nurse-patient ratios regulation, which California put in place in 2004, with positive results. Similar legislation was proposed and defeated in Massachusetts several years ago with help from a 25-million-U.S. dollar ""no"" campaign funded by the hospital lobby. However, such a plan is currently on the table in Illinois and Pennsylvania. These laws could save patients' lives and create a more just work environment for a vulnerable generation of nurses, the ones the country pledged to honor and protect at the start of the pandemic. U.S. National Nurses United has been an active advocate of the nurse-patient ratios regulation, saying that ""safe staffing ratios, coupled with nurses' powerful voice of advocacy secured in collective bargaining, protect our patients from complications that arise from missed care such as medical errors, health care disparities, infections, and so much more."" ""Decades of studies have shown that more nurses equate to lives saved and fewer complications. Researchers have been focusing on what exactly is the mediating link between increasing RN (registered nurse) staffing and improved outcomes,"" it added.",Xinhua,2023-01-11 13:29
630,U.S. Los Angeles County declares state of emergency over homeless crisis,"LOS ANGELES, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- Los Angeles County in the United States approved a motion on Tuesday to declare a state of emergency over the region's homeless crisis.

634,2022 becomes New Zealand's warmest year on record,"WELLINGTON, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- The year 2022 became New Zealand's warmest on record, knocking 2021 off the top spot, scientists said Wednesday. 2022 was also the eighth most unusually wet year on record, the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) chief scientist Chris Brandolino told a press conference. New Zealand's nationwide average temperature was 13.76 degrees Celsius, 1.15 degrees Celsius above the 1981-2010 annual average and surpassing 2021 by 0.2 degrees, according to the 2022 Annual Climate Summary released on Wednesday. November 2022 was the most unusually warm month, the summary said. The top four warmest years on record have all occurred since 2016, Brandolino said, adding La Ni a was one of the primary drivers of last year's weather patterns. Sea surface temperatures near New Zealand also had a big impact, being above or well above average every month and resulting in a marine heatwave for most of the year, he said. Last year, the highest air temperature was 34.7 degrees Celsius at Lake Karapiro in Waikato on Jan. 3 and the lowest was -11.6 degrees Celsius at Mt Cook Airport on July 17, according to the 2022 Annual Climate Summary.

635,How to feed 8 bln people -- a look at global food security in 2023," BEIJING, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- As the world's population hit a new milestone of 8 billion people in 2022, the task of ensuring global food security has become even more critical. However, due to climate change, geopolitical crises and a global economic slowdown, the international food market is expected to remain uncertain in 2023, and some low-income countries may remain trapped in the food shortage dilemma. If history is any guide, a global crisis necessitates global cooperation. Only by strengthening coordination, facilitating supply chains, and focusing on eliminating long-term and structurally persistent problems that undermine the resilience of the global food system will the international community be able to better meet global food security challenges.    2022 saw a rapid increase in food prices and shortages of food supplies around the world. ""The world is facing a food crisis of unprecedented proportions, the largest in modern history,"" the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) said in a report last year. In its joint research with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the WFP found that as many as 828 million people go to bed hungry every night. The compounding food security crisis in various parts of the world was caused by a combination of geopolitical and economic crises, as well as global warming. Unfortunately, the factors that contributed to the crisis last year are still in place. Both Russia and Ukraine are important grain exporters, and Russia is also a major fertilizer exporter. According to figures by the WFP, Russia and Ukraine together account for 30 percent of global wheat exports. In February 2022, international food prices rose in response to the escalation of the Ukraine crisis, exacerbating the food crisis. In March 2022, the FAO Food Price Index reached its highest level on record since 1990, at 159.7 points. Though grain exports from Russia are not officially subject to sanctions against Russia, the West has erected ""invisible barriers"" to Russian agricultural exports, Eduard Zernin, head of the Russian Union of Grain Exporters, told Interfax. What's worse, the United States has coerced its allies into tightening sanctions against Russia, affecting international energy and fertilizer supplies and driving up agricultural input costs, which could affect global agricultural production in the coming growing season and further drive up food prices. Multiple heat and drought events in the Northern Hemisphere in 2022 also hampered winter wheat production in several major producing regions, and global corn production is also expected to be lower than the previous year's level. Due to limited international supply, wheat and corn prices will remain volatile in 2023 and highly sensitive to changes in weather conditions and related policies. Meanwhile, some major economies are currently in recession or experiencing significant slowing, and the global economic downturn poses risks to food security.    Last December, the FAO projected that global cereal production would be 2.756 billion tons in 2022, based on separate cereal supply and demand estimates. Observers believe that despite the fact that the global population has reached 8 billion, there should no longer be a food security crisis given the total global food production. The unequal distribution of food between and within countries has caused hunger for many millions of people worldwide. In the past decades, the core exporting countries have been stable and concentrated, while the core importing countries have been relatively dispersed. Food self-sufficiency is particularly low in developing countries as a whole. In Africa, for example, more than 30 countries are net food importers. Because of this supply and demand pattern, the international food market is highly vulnerable to epidemics, regional conflicts and other factors. In recent years, many food exporting countries have implemented protectionist policies, citing concerns over food supply and rising food prices. As of July 2022, 21 countries had implemented food export bans and six countries had implemented export restrictions, according to data from the International Food Policy Research Institute. If major food exporting countries tighten trade restrictions, international food prices will undoubtedly rise. The continued aggressive interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the appreciation of the U.S. dollar have also resulted in a significant increase in the financial burden on some low-income countries, which are highly dependent on food imports, further threatening the food security of vulnerable groups. Meanwhile, Western companies at the heart of the global grain trade have enjoyed a record bonanza as global food prices soar, raising concerns of profiteering and speculation in global food markets. In an interview with The Guardian, Olivier De Schutter, former UN special rapporteur on the right to food, said that the fact that global commodity giants, mainly the Archer Daniels Midland Company, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus, are making record profits at a time when hunger is rising ""is clearly unjust, and is a terrible indictment of our food systems."" ""Global grain markets are even more concentrated than energy markets and even less transparent, so there is a huge risk of profiteering,"" said De Schutter, noting that the food price surge in 2022 happened despite what were thought to be abundant global grain reserves. There was insufficient transparency from the companies to show how much grain they hold and no way to force them to release stocks in a timely way, he said.    Despite the recent drop in global food prices, the issue of food supply and security stays unaddressed. How to eliminate the threat of food security remains a common challenge for the international community in the new year. In the face of this common threat, food security has emerged as a major concern at major international multilateral conferences in recent years. During the 12th Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in June 2022, the Ministerial Declaration on the Emergency Response to Food Insecurity was issued, the first multilateral declaration addressing the issue of food insecurity in WTO history. It stresses members' concerns about trade disruptions, record-high prices and excessive price volatility for food and agricultural products as threats to world food security. During the 17th Group of 20 (G20) Summit in Indonesia's resort island of Bali in November 2022, leaders pledged to take urgent actions to address the vulnerabilities of developing countries, and called for an accelerated transformation towards sustainable and resilient agriculture and food systems and supply chains. ""We will take further coordinated actions to address food security challenges including price surges and shortage of food commodities and fertilizers globally,"" said the G20 Bali Leaders' Declaration. On how international trade can help achieve more efficient, inclusive, resilient and sustainable food systems, Dominique Fernand Burgeon, director of the FAO liaison office with the United Nations in Geneva, said that to reduce disruptions to global agricultural trade, the first step should be to improve market transparency and promote policy dialogue. Countries should consider the potential damage to international markets from trade restrictive measures, and vigorously implement trade facilitation measures and carry out international cooperation, he said at an international conference on agricultural trade policy last November. To feed the world's 8 billion people, the international community should promote free trade and keep food trade flowing smoothly, with a particular focus on resolving the disruptions in the food supply chain caused by the Ukraine crisis as soon as possible, said Tang Jian, a vice professor from the Institute for International Strategic Studies of the Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The major countries should also collaborate on how to provide global public goods, with the United Nations taking the lead, Tang said, adding that an early warning system for the food market should be established in order to predict which regions may face food crises and take precautions accordingly.",Xinhua,2023-01-11 13:42
631,"Biden says ""surprised"" to learn classified documents taken to his private office","WASHINGTON/MEXICO CITY, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Joe Biden said on Tuesday that he was ""surprised"" that government records were taken to one of his former private offices. ""I was surprised to learn there were any government records that were taken there to that office,"" Biden told reporters in Mexico City where he had a trilateral summit with the leaders of Mexico and Canada. Biden said he doesn't know ""what's in the documents"" that were found in a locked closet when his attorneys were vacating office space at the Penn Biden Center in Washington, D.C. The Penn Biden Center is a think tank not far from the White House, affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania and named for Biden, a veteran Democrat who served as U.S. vice president from January 2009 to January 2017. White House special counsel Richard Sauber issued a statement on Monday, saying that Biden periodically used this space from mid-2017 until the start of his 2020 presidential campaign. This discovery of ""what appears to be Obama-Biden Administration records, including a small number of documents with classified markings"" was made in early November of 2022, according to the statement. ""They found some documents in a box in a locked cabinet, or at least a closet. And as soon as they did, they realized there were several classified documents in that box,"" Biden said on Tuesday. The attorneys ""did what they should have done"" by immediately calling the National Archives, he added. The classified documents found inside the Penn Biden Center closet are reportedly U.S. intelligence memos and briefing materials that covered topics including Ukraine, Iran and Britain. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland is said to have tasked the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois John Lausch Jr. with reviewing the matter. U.S. Congressman James Comer, a Republican who chairs the House Oversight Committee, told CNN that he plans to press the National Archives, which his committee oversees, for information about the classified documents. The U.S. Department of Justice is also investigating former President Donald Trump's handling of a trove of classified documents seized from his estate in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, by federal agents in the summer of 2022. Trump, a Republican, responded to the news of classified documents found at the Penn Biden Center, posting on social media on Monday that ""when is the FBI going to raid the many homes of Joe Biden, perhaps even the White House?"" ""President Biden has been very critical of President Trump mistakenly taking classified documents to the residence or wherever, and now it seems he may have done the same,"" Comer said. ""How ironic."" The Presidential Records Act requires all presidential and vice-presidential documents to be turned over to the National Archives.",Xinhua,2023-01-11 13:58

Under the revamped safeguard mechanism, Australia's 215 biggest industrial polluters will be forced to cut their emissions by 30 percent by 2030. From July 1, the facilities will be subject to a binding pollution cap that will fall by 4.9 percent every year. The safeguard mechanism is the Labor government's signature climate policy and will be the first legislation that compels the industry to cut emissions since the carbon tax was repealed in 2014. Chris Bowen, minister for climate change and energy, told reporters on Tuesday that the policy would ensure big polluters do their bit to help Australia achieve its goal to reduce emissions by 43 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. ""Facilities covered by the safeguard mechanism are responsible for almost a third of Australia's emissions,"" Bowen said. ""Twenty-eight percent of emissions come from them -- we will require 28 percent of emissions reduction to come from safeguard facilities,"" he added.",Xinhua,2023-01-11 14:21
666,Thousands of nurses go on strike for 3rd day in New York City,"  NEW YORK, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of nurses from New York City's Mount Sinai Hospital and Montefiore Bronx continued to be on strike the third day on staffing shortage, low wage and other issues. Hundreds of nurses wearing red hats continued to line both sides of Madison Avenue near the entrance of Mount Sinai Hospital on Wednesday morning. Meanwhile, another smaller group of nurses rallied at the 5th Avenue on another side of Mount Sinai Hospital complex. Nurses called for more nurses and enforcement of safe staffing requirements while complaining heft salaries and bonuses for management of the hospitals. Minna Scott, a registered nurse at Mount Sinai Hospital, told Xinhua, ""99 percent of nurses have voted to authorize the strike and we're all out here rallying on the street."" Mount Sinai is a private hospital, so it is not under the laws of the New York State to enforce any of the labor laws including that on staffing ratio, according to Scott. Currently, there are over 500 vacancies of nurses and nurses have to work overtime because of short staffing, said Scott. ""Every day there are more nurses leaving the hospital, not only because they are tired, not because they have enough, but because they are refusing to practice under unsafe labor,"" added Scott. ""Nurses do not get paid enough. The head of this hospital, according to the Internal Revenue Service, makes 12,437,000 dollars a year. Sure, they could support the nurses and give them raises,"" said Lorraine Skeen, a retired teacher, who came out in solidarity with nurses. It's reported that around 7,000 nurses from the two hospitals joined the strike while Mount Sinai Morningside and Mount Sinai West reached a tentative agreement with the state nursing union on a new contract Sunday with a strike avoided. The strike will continue until agreements can be reached and the key sticking point in negotiations is making sure there are enough nurses at the bedside to safely care for patients, said a release by the New York State Nurses Association on Wednesday.",Xinhua,2023-01-12 09:47

638,Croatia not to impose restrictive COVID measures on Chinese passengers,"ZAGREB, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- Croatia will not impose restrictive COVID-19 measures on Chinese passengers entering the country, Bernard Kaic, head of the Department for Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases at the Croatian Institute of Public Health (HZJZ), said on Wednesday. ""Since we do not consider mandatory inspections an efficient method for the prevention of the COVID-19 variants into the country, we do not intend to impose mandatory inspections, as long as it is not a requirement of all EU (European Union) member states,"" Kaic, authorized by the Croatian Ministry of Health, told Xinhua in an interview. Croatia will not follow the examples of some Western European countries to take restrictive COVID-19 measures on Chinese passengers, Kaic said, noting that the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has said that it is ""unjustified"" and unnecessary to impose mandatory inspections on passengers from China. As the COVID-19 virus is already present in Croatia and all over the EU, ""it is no big deal if a Chinese passenger with COVID-19 virus enters Croatia,"" Kaic noted. Croatia welcomes Chinese tourists and ""we look forward to their arrival and there are no obstacles for that,"" Kaic added. ""We warmly welcome Chinese tourists, because they are our dear guests,"" said Kristijan Stanicic, director of the Croatian National Tourist Board (CNTB), adding that the CNTB will do everything to facilitate the arrival and stay of Chinese tourists in Croatia.",Xinhua,2023-01-12 15:08

""The tribal gunmen stormed a key military site of the government forces in Abyan's district of Lawdar, sparking hours of intense clashes late Tuesday night,"" the local military source said on condition of anonymity. The clashes that lasted several hours killed at least five people, including three soldiers, and injured several others from both sides, he said. The armed confrontations were caused by disputes over the deployment of patrols in the area between the two sides, the source noted. The security authorities in Abyan have set up an investigation committee and managed to cease the hostilities following a meeting with local military commanders and tribal leaders, according to the source. During the past months, military units of the Southern Transitional Council, which is a part of the Yemeni government, announced they were launching ""a qualitative anti-terror operation and succeeded in raiding a key hideout of al-Qaida in Abyan."" Scores of al-Qaida militants hiding out in rocky and mountainous areas of Abyan and other neighboring provinces frequently carry out hit-and-run raids against Yemeni government forces. The Yemen-based al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula network has exploited years of deadly conflict between the Yemeni government and the Houthi militia to expand its presence in the war-ravaged Arab country. It has carried out many high-profile attacks against the security forces in the country's southern provinces.",Xinhua,2023-01-12 15:12
641,Feature: Türkiye's cultural hub Istanbul gets ready for Chinese tourists,"  ISTANBUL, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- Türkiye's cultural and financial heart, Istanbul, the only city in the world spanning Europe and Asia, is preparing for the arrival of Chinese tourists. Soon after China downgraded its COVID-19 measures on Jan. 8, easing international travel, tourism representatives in the city started discussing ways to attract more Chinese travelers with a wide range of promotional activities. ""The opening of the Chinese market is essential to us,"" Murat Arslan, general manager of CVK Park Bosphorus Hotel, told Xinhua in an interview. ""We know Chinese people travel a lot in Istanbul. Rather than sea, sand, and sun, they have a more cultural and gastronomic experience-oriented travel understanding,"" Arslan noted. According to Arslan, Istanbul offers a lot for Chinese tourists, including boat tours on the Bosphorus Strait flowing between the European and Asian sides; the historical peninsula of Sultanahmet; ancient palaces, churches and mosques; and a vivid nightlife with numerous restaurants and bars. The hotel manager said travel representatives have sped up efforts to offer a unique experience to Chinese visitors to the city. Meanwhile, Arslan's teams are updating the hotel's menus to introduce a wide range of Turkish delicacies.   ""We are also considering a trip to China soon. Again, we continue to work nonstop on Turkish tourism to get a larger share of the cake from China's market,"" he said. Ali Can Aksu, head of the Turkish Hotel Managers Association, told Xinhua that Chinese travelers are significant for global tourism. ""The entire world measures the needs of Chinese tourists and acts accordingly. It is also followed very closely by Türkiye,"" Aksu said. In Aksu's view, the Chinese should not be perceived as tourists. They have the spirit of a traveler. ""They have a different understanding of tourism and want to explore new adventures and discover new places, areas, and destinations. So, as a country, we attach great importance to them."" According to Aksu, Türkiye's tourism sector wants to attract 1 million travelers from China. After hosting over 420,000 Chinese tourists in 2019, Türkiye had initially projected to attract nearly 1 million by the end of 2020. However, most activities were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""We are waiting for our Chinese brothers and sisters, and we intend to give them a taste of Türkiye's vast unexplored paradise,"" Aksu said.

640,Former UN chief urges for solidarity to tackle global challenges in Hong Kong,"HONG KONG, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- All countries need to work together to address pressing global challenges and attain the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said here on Wednesday. Ban made the remarks at the 2023 Asian Financial Forum inaugurated at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre on Wednesday. The two-day forum, organized by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, was held in a hybrid format under the theme ""Accelerating Transformation: Impact, Inclusion, Innovation."" In his keynote speech, Ban said geopolitical tensions, climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic, among other crises, profoundly peril humanity and the earth, stressing the need for global solutions. The UN SDGs, with the vision of ""no one is left behind,"" offer a collaborative blueprint and have made tangible progress in addressing critical global issues such as hunger and poverty, Ban said, adding that he was confident that attaining the SDGs will bring the world together and help ""rebuild society better, greener and more resilient."" In particular, the former UN chief highlighted the need for multilateral cooperation in tackling climate change, calling on all countries to take responsibility for expediting decarbonization. Ban spoke highly of China's active action in climate change mitigation and adaptation, and appreciated China's strong commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. He urged all stakeholders to ""strengthen cooperation, innovation, engagement and action"" while forging new partnerships, leveling the digital playing field, promoting science and technology, and enhancing education, transparency and accountability. Financial leaders also have a crucial role to play in the financial support for global adaptation of climate change, he added.

613,Biden aides find second batch of classified documents at different location: media,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- A second batch of classified documents belonging to U.S. President Joe Biden was reportedly discovered by his aides at a new location, according to multiple U.S. media outlets on Wednesday. The news emerged two days after White House special counsel Richard Sauber released a statement, saying that ""a small number of documents with classified markings"" were found at one of Biden's former private offices in Washington, D.C. The new batch was reported to have been found at a separate location from the initial one inside the Penn Biden Center, a think tank affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania and named for Biden. Sauber said Biden, a Democrat who served as U.S. vice president from January 2009 to January 2017, periodically used this space from mid-2017 until the start of his 2020 presidential campaign. Since the discovery of the first group of classified documents on Nov. 2, 2022, White House aides have been looking for any additional classified documents in other locations, according to NBC News. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre refused to say on Wednesday why the Biden administration did not inform the public sooner. The discovery was made six days ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. Jean-Pierre told reporters at the White House briefing that the situation was under review by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and that she would not comment on it further. Biden said on Tuesday he was ""surprised to learn there were any government records that were taken there to that office"" while in Mexico City, where he had a trilateral summit with the leaders of Mexico and Canada. He added he did not know ""what's in the documents"" that were found in a locked closet when his attorneys were vacating office space at the Penn Biden Center. The classified documents inside the Penn Biden Center closet are reportedly U.S. intelligence memos and briefing materials covering topics including Ukraine, Iran and Britain. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland is said to have tasked the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, John Lausch Jr., with reviewing the matter. U.S. Congressman James Comer, a Republican who chairs the House Oversight Committee, has said that he plans to press the National Archives, which his committee oversees, for information about the classified documents. The DOJ is also investigating former President Donald Trump's handling of a trove of classified documents seized from his estate in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, by federal agents in the summer of 2022. The Presidential Records Act requires all presidential and vice-presidential documents to be turned over to the National Archives.",Xinhua,2023-01-12 16:39
608,"China's reopening to inject new impetus into Cambodian, world tourism growth","PHNOM PENH, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Tourism Minister Thong Khon said on Wednesday that China's optimization of its pandemic control policies will give new momentum to tourism growth in Cambodia and the rest of the world. ""On behalf of the government and the Ministry of Tourism, I would like to welcome the return of Chinese tourists to Cambodia,"" he told Xinhua. ""As we all know, China was the most important outbound tourism market for the world, so China's resumption of outbound tourism is very beneficial not only to Cambodia, but also to the whole world,"" he said. Khon said the Southeast Asian nation is ready to welcome Chinese people, tourists and investors, saying they have significantly contributed to the kingdom's socio-economic development and poverty reduction. ""After China's reopening on January 8, we hope that Cambodia will attract at least one million Chinese tourists in 2023,"" he said, noting that Cambodia received only 110,000 Chinese tourists in 2022. As the Chinese Spring Festival draws near, the minister expressed his hope that more Chinese tourists will spend their holidays in Cambodia on the occasion. Cambodia received 2.36 million Chinese tourists in the pre-COVID-19 pandemic era in 2019, generating about 1.8 billion U.S. dollars in revenue, according to the Ministry of Tourism. Khon said the number of Chinese tourists to Cambodia is expected to reach the pre-pandemic level in 2024. Thourn Sinan, chairman of the Pacific Asia Travel Association Cambodia chapter, agreed that China's resumption of outbound tourism would drive global tourism growth including Cambodia in the post-pandemic era. ""It's not only Cambodia, but also the world is waiting for the return of the Chinese tourists to their countries,"" he told Xinhua. Sinan said China is one of the main sources of tourists to Cambodia, pointing out that the presence of Chinese tourists has greatly contributed to the development of tourism in the kingdom. ""We are ready to welcome and we are quite busy these few weeks to redesign package tours and to redesign services for Chinese tourists, so it is very good news for all of us,"" he said. Sinan said Cambodia is a popular destination for both Chinese holiday makers and investors, given the historical and close relationship between the two countries. Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Techo Hun Sen said in a public speech earlier this month that the presence of Chinese tourists is vital to the country's tourism and economic growth and that the country will not follow some other nations in imposing COVID-19 related restrictions on Chinese tourists' arrivals. Tourism is one of the four major pillars supporting Cambodia's economy. In the pre-pandemic era, the country registered 6.6 million international tourists in 2019, generating 4.92 billion U.S. dollars in revenue that contributed 12.1 percent to the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Cambodia is famous for its three world heritage sites, namely the Angkor Archaeological Park in Siem Reap province, the Preah Vihear Temple in Preah Vihear province, and the Sambor Prei Kuk Archaeological Site in Kampong Thom province. Besides, it has a 450-km pristine coastline stretching across four southwestern provinces.",Xinhua,2023-01-12 16:42
609,Compulsory COVID testing for travelers from China unnecessary: Swiss authority,"GENEVA, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- The current COVID-19 epidemiological situation ""does not presently warrant compulsory testing for travelers from China,"" according to Swiss health authority. The Omicron variants presently circulating in China pose only a small risk to Switzerland, it has said. The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) said in a statement that the Swiss Federal Council had discussed the latest European Union (EU) recommendations, which would require passengers flying from China to the EU to have a negative COVID-19 test before boarding. The Swiss authority has, however, decided that ""travelers from China should not be required to undergo compulsory COVID-19 testing at the present time."" ""People in Switzerland currently have strong protection against developing severe COVID-19: many of them have already been vaccinated or have already been infected and recovered,"" it said. The present infection trends in China ""are not expected to pose an increased risk to the Swiss population or the Swiss health system,"" the statement said. The FOPH also said that the Omicron variants currently circulating in China ""are already extensively distributed in Switzerland or are already on the decline."" The circulation of the virus in Switzerland is currently so high that ""compulsorily testing the relatively small number of persons arriving in the country from China directly by air would have minimal impact on the virus's current spread,"" it noted. ""The risk of new virus variants of concern developing is also no higher in China than elsewhere,"" it added. According to local media, around 97 percent of the Swiss population have developed antibodies against the virus via vaccination or infection. The numbers of both new infections and people being tested have been steadily falling in the country.",Xinhua,2023-01-12 17:02
606,New US border measures could undermine fundamental human rights: UN rights chief,"GENEVA, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- New border enforcement measures announced by the U.S. could undermine the foundations of international human rights and refugee law, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said Wednesday. ""These measures appear to be at variance with the prohibition of collective expulsion and the principle of non-refoulement,"" the UN Human Rights Chief said. The measures include the increased use of expedited removals, and expansion of the use of the Title 42 public health order allowing for the fast-track expulsion to Mexico of some 30,000 Venezuelans, Haitians, Cubans and Nicaraguans each month. According to the UN figures, Title 42 has already been used by US immigration officials some 2.5 million times at the southern border, to expel people to Mexico or their home country without an individualized assessment of all their protection needs, due process and procedural safeguards. The High Commissioner also expressed concern that those most in need of asylum and those in vulnerable situations are unlikely to meet the requirements to be granted humanitarian parole, including having a financial sponsor in the USA. ""We hear a great deal of talk about migration crises, but in reality, it is those migrating who often are the ones truly in crisis. Rather than vilifying them and stripping them of long-recognized rights, we should be seeking to govern migration humanely and safely with full respect for the human rights of every individual,"" he stressed.",Xinhua,2023-01-12 17:05

610,UN agency says past 8 years warmest on record,"   GENEVA, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- Soaring greenhouse gas levels and accumulated heat have led to the warmest eight years on record, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Thursday. According to temperature data gathered by WMO, 2022 was the eighth consecutive year when annual global temperatures reached at least one degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The landmark 2015 Paris Agreement pledged to keep global warming ""well below"" two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and to strive for a lower limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius. Meanwhile, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has underlined that global warming should be limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius or below.   However, the latest WMO data has shown that the average global temperature in 2022 was around 1.15 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, while the ten-year average temperature for the period 2013-2022 was 1.14 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial baseline. This indicates that long-term warming continues, and the likelihood of temporarily breaching the 1.5 degrees Celsius target is increasing, said WMO. Global warming and other long-term climate change trends are expected to continue, WMO said, due to record levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Extreme heatwaves, drought and devastating flooding affected millions and cost billions in 2022, according to WMO's provisional State of the Global Climate in 2022 report.   ""There is a need to enhance preparedness for such extreme events and to ensure that we meet the UN target of Early Warnings for All in the next five years,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. ""Today only half of 193 (WMO) members have proper early warning services, which leads to much higher economic and human losses. There are also big gaps in basic weather observations in Africa and island states, which has a major negative impact on the quality of weather forecasts,"" he warned.",Xinhua,2023-01-13 08:27
615,Türkiye enters new year with pay hikes but falling living standards,"  ANKARA, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- Türkiye has ushered in the new year with significant pay hikes for minimum-wage earners, pensioners, and civil servants amid a cost-of-living crisis that has plunged millions into financial hardship. Inflation remains alarmingly high despite a sharp drop to 64.2 percent in December, the Turkish Statistical Institute announced on Jan. 3, down from 84.3 percent reported in November after hitting a 24-year high in October. Annual food prices rose by 77.9 percent in December, down from 102.6 percent in November, while energy prices increased 118 percent, down from 94.4 percent compared to the previous month. The government announced a 55-percent increase in the official minimum wage for 2023 to a monthly 8,500 Turkish liras (453 U.S. dollars), raised salaries for civil servants, and hiked pensions by 30 percent to ease households' pressure stemming from runaway inflation.   Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also announced a measure that would allow over 2 million people to potentially retire immediately, but the spending spree as a result of the measure is expected to swell the budget, according to experts. The government has as well launched a long-awaited income housing loan campaign for mid-income citizens and relief measures for businesses. Erdogan, who faces tight presidential and parliamentary elections in June, had promised a serious drop in the inflation rate in the new year. ""We expect similar base-driven effects to continue for a few more months, bringing inflation down to 40 percent in the period leading up to the election,"" Enver Erkan, chief economist at Istanbul's Tera Securities, said in a note to investors. ""Despite this, we still need to talk about a public expenditure increase that can feed periodic price increases before the election,"" the expert warned. Most opinion polls show the president and his ruling Justice and Development Party, who are in power for more than two decades, have lost some support in recent years, as the currency depreciated and living costs rose. While wages have been increased for millions, price hikes continued on a wide range of services and goods in January. Following a price increase of 29 percent in mass transport fees in Istanbul, Türkiye's largest city, the capital city Ankara has followed suit with around 35 percent rise for commuters, the municipalities announced. Alcohol and cigarette prices saw an increase of 22.2 percent while the prices of most essential food products such as bread, eggs, meat, and dairy have hiked between 30 and 50 percent, according to the local press.   In Ankara's residential Cankaya district, citizens have expressed frustration with the government's wage hikes. ""The wage hikes are insufficient and have already been eroded"" by soaring food prices, Adem Cam, a 70-year-old pensioner, told Xinhua. The man who still works in the real estate sector said it is impossible to get by with a minimum wage in a family of four, calling on the government to work on measures that would refrain retailers from hiking their prices. ""They may have hiked wages by 30 to 40 percent, but food prices are going up unabated ... Therefore the salary increases don't mean anything because the price of essential goods has gone up,"" he said. ""In the past, we could go somewhere to eat or drink with my spouse and my children, but now this has become impossible,"" Cam lamented his falling purchasing power. According to a report released in December of 2022 by the Confederation of Turkish Trade Unions, the poverty threshold increased to 26,481 liras, which is over three times the recently hiked minimum wage. Most Turkish households are not feeling the marked decline in the inflation rate and are still struggling to make ends meet.   ""I don't feel a drop in inflation. For me, the inflation rate is around 300 percent,"" said Nihat Basaran, a 52-year-old retired army personnel. ""There is a big difference in price in the items that you buy yesterday compared to today. Yesterday was better than today, and today will be better than tomorrow,"" he added.",Xinhua,2023-01-13 09:16

""First and foremost, I urge all member states to uphold the vision and the values of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and to abide by international law,"" the UN chief told a Security Council meeting on the promotion and strengthening of the rule of law in the maintenance of international peace and security. Noting that the rule of law is ""foundational to the United Nations, and to our mission of peace,"" and that the cornerstone of the rule of law is that ""all people, institutions, and entities, public and private, including the state itself, are accountable before the law,"" the top UN official said the rule of law protects the vulnerable, and prevents discrimination, harassment and other abuses. ""It is our first line of defense against atrocity crimes, including genocide. It creates and bolsters trust in institutions. It supports fair, inclusive economies and societies. And it is the basis of international cooperation and multilateralism,"" he said. The debate on this topic at the Security Council, said Guterres, ""sends a strong message that ensuring the rule of law is our priority, and that all countries must adhere to international standards."" ""We are at grave risk of the Rule of Lawlessness,"" he warned.   The rule of law is foundational to efforts by the United Nations to find peaceful solutions to all these conflicts, disasters and crises and more, and to support the most vulnerable people and communities around the world, said the UN chief. ""I count on member states to support our efforts to promote the rule of law across the board, including on this council,"" he added. While the challenges are many, the primacy of the rule of law is essential to the maintenance of international peace and security and for peacebuilding efforts, he said. ""I urge member states to make full use of the rule of law as a preventive tool."" He also urged the international community to reinforce the rule of law as a key enabler to achieve the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, noting that ""Goal 16 on access to justice for all and effective, inclusive and accountable institutions is a critical enabler for the other SDGs."" Turning to his report on Our Common Agenda, Guterres said it calls for a new vision for the rule of law ""that is an opportunity to reset and reinforce the centrality of the rule of law in all activities of our organization."" The rule of law is key to addressing existing and future challenges, from nuclear disarmament to the climate crisis, the collapse of biodiversity, pandemics and dangerous diseases, he stressed, adding that the United Nations is uniquely positioned to lead in promoting innovation and progress in accordance with the rule of law.

An official statement said Ishtaye made the remarks during a meeting with Hady Amr, the U.S. special representative for Palestinian affairs in the State Department's Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs. The two sides discussed the unilateral practices taken by the new Israeli government, headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, against the Palestinian people as soon as it assumed power.   ""The U.S. government is required to move urgently to put an end to the unilateral Israeli measures and threats that undermine the national authority and systematically end the possibility of establishing a Palestinian state,"" Ishtaye told Amr. He pointed to a need for the upcoming visit of U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan to the region to carry a message of hope for the Palestinian people. ""The two U.S. officials should deliver a clear statement to the Israeli government that it is obligated to respect international law and the agreements Israel signed with the Palestinians,"" Ishtaye said.   He urged the United States ""to exert real pressure on the Israeli government to stop all violations and release the Palestinian tax revenue dues it had illegally deducted."" Ishtaye said the Palestinian people and their leadership ""will not accept the fait accompli and will move forward in the popular, political, diplomatic and legal struggle in the face of the Israeli measures."" On Friday, the Israeli cabinet for security and political affairs approved punitive measures against the Palestinian Authority for its approach to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.   The punitive measures included the deduction of 39.6 million U.S. dollars from the Palestinian tax revenue dues and the freezing of building permits in Area C, which is under full Israeli control in the West Bank. The Palestinians want to establish an independent state on the territories seized by Israel in 1967, including the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.",Xinhua,2023-01-13 09:23
612,Global warming driving shift in water cycle: Australian study,"CANBERRA, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- An Australian report has warned that global warming is changing the global water cycle. The Global Water Monitor Consortium, led by the Australian National University (ANU), on Thursday released its first report, warning that flash droughts will become more common in the short-term future. According to the report, the water cycle in 2022 was dominated by warmer-than-average ocean waters in the western Pacific and eastern and northern Indian Ocean, driving severe heat waves in South Asia and a severe monsoon that caused flooding in Pakistan. In Europe and China, it said heat waves caused droughts to develop rapidly while a third consecutive La Ni a event caused catastrophic flooding in Australia but exacerbated droughts in North and South America. Overall air temperature over land followed the long-term warming trend in 2022 while humidity declined. ""This means that nature, crops and people will need more water to stay healthy, which compounds the problem,"" Albert van Dijk, lead author of the report from the Centre for Water and Landscape Dynamics at ANU's Fenner School of Environment and Society, said in a media release. ""It is a safe prediction that we will see more and more of these heatwaves and flash droughts. We also see evidence of the impact of global warming on glaciers and the water cycle in cold regions, and in fact melting glaciers contributed to the Pakistan floods.

617,"Iran summons Swedish envoy over European officials' ""meddlesome"" remarks","TEHRAN, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday summoned the Swedish ambassador to Iran to protest ""meddlesome"" remarks by certain European officials, according to the ministry's website. During the meeting with Swedish ambassador Mattias Lentz, whose country currently holds the presidency of the Council of the European Union, the Director General of the Western Europe department at the Iranian Foreign Ministry condemned any interference in Iran's internal affairs, stressing that justifying insults to religious and national values of other nations on the ground of freedom is a betrayal of the sacred concept of freedom and cruelty to human beings and human rights. Turning to some European states' roles in promoting violence and hate-mongering in other countries, the Iranian diplomat said interference in other states' internal affairs is in contradiction with all international rules and regulations and will not be tolerated by Iran. The official also called on the Swedish ambassador to urge the European sides to stop their ""destructive"" approach of interference in Iran's domestic affairs. Over the past weeks, different senior officials of some European states have slammed Iran's handling of the recent protests in the country that erupted following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini. She died in a Tehran hospital on Sept. 16, 2022, a few days after her collapse at a police station. Iran has accused the United States and some other Western countries of ""inciting riots and supporting terrorists"" in the country, and has executed some of the ""rioters"" over the past weeks, which has also been criticized by some European states. As the latest instance of such criticisms by European officials, a few days ago, the EU condemned the execution of two men, named Mohammad Mehdi Karami and Mohammad Hosseini, who were charged with ""killing a member of the Basij volunteer force during the riots.""",Xinhua,2023-01-13 16:32

Following the availability and use of the updated vaccine, CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink, a near real-time surveillance system, met the statistical criteria to prompt additional investigation into ""whether there was a safety concern"" for ischemic stroke in people aged 65 and older who received the updated vaccine, according to a statement on the CDC website. The investigation ""raised a question of whether"" stroke risk was elevated in the 21-day period post-vaccination versus 22 to 44 days post-vaccination, according to the CDC. A preliminary study using the U.S. Veterans Affairs database did not indicate an increased risk of ischemic stroke following the updated vaccine, according to the CDC. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System managed by CDC and FDA has not seen an increase in reporting of ischemic strokes following the vaccine.

642,Omicron new subvariant strains U.S. hospitals amid fast spread,"LOS ANGELES, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- Omicron new subvariant XBB.1.5 is spreading quickly in the United States during the third COVID-19 winter, straining U.S. hospital systems and causing staffing shortages. XBB.1.5 is estimated to account for 43 percent of COVID-19 cases in the United States for the week ending Jan. 14, according to data released Friday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). XBB.1.5 is currently the most transmissible variant in the country. It made up 30.4 percent of the total cases in the week ending Jan. 7, rising from 20.1 percent from a week before and 11.8 percent from two weeks prior, according to the CDC. The World Health Organization said earlier this week XBB.1.5 may spur more COVID-19 cases based on genetic characteristics and early growth rate estimates. Public health officials are closely monitoring the spread of XBB.1.5, the most transmissible form of the coronavirus yet seen. The mutations XBB.1.5 has acquired have made it more contagious. A more transmissible strain has the evolutionary advantage that it will spread faster than others, and therefore could displace other strains, according to health experts. However, this new strain does not appear to cause more severe disease. Like other Omicron descendants, it probably causes milder illness compared with the Delta variants that predated Omicron. There are some studies that suggest XBB.1.5 is more immune-evasive compared with previously dominant Omicron strains. Further research is underway to identify the degree of immune protection afforded by existing vaccines. The rise in the new variant correlated with an uptick in COVID-19 cases in United States over the last six weeks. Winter has traditionally been crunchtime for hospitals because of influenza and another seasonal pathogen, respiratory syncytial virus. Now SARS-CoV-2 has joined them to form an unholy trinity of pathogens that surge in the cold months. With respiratory viruses across the country, hospitals nationwide are facing severe shortages of beds and staff to provide adequate care for patients. White House COVID-19 response coordinator Ashish Jha said the American health-care system may not be able to withstand the continued viral onslaught, which strains the system's ability to care for other serious illnesses. As the United States enters the third full COVID-19 winter, officials are warning the permanence of the coronavirus in the disease landscape could mean brutal and long-lasting seasonal surges of cold-weather illnesses for years to come, said a report of The Washington Post. ""I am worried that we are going to have, for years, our health system being pretty dysfunctional, not being able to take care of heart attack patients, not being able to take care of cancer patients, not being able to take care of the kid who's got appendicitis because we're going to be so overwhelmed with respiratory viruses for ... three or four months a year,"" Jha told the newspaper.",Xinhua,2023-01-14 09:40

""America's relationship to the gun is anything but rational ... and therefore we have done little or nothing to fix the problem,"" the review, published on Wednesday, quoted Auster's book as saying. The fix to U.S. gun violence does not reside in banning the manufacture and sale of all guns -- because attempting to do so would be as impractical and ineffective as the banning of alcohol during prohibition, which criminalized ordinary people and created a flourishing black market, the review said while summarizing the points in Auster's book. ""Peace will break out only when both sides want it, and in order for that to happen, we would first have to conduct an honest, gut-wrenching examination of who we are and who we want to be as a people going forward into the future, which necessarily would have to begin with an honest gut-wrenching examination of who we have been in the past,"" it quoted Auster's book as saying.

Current in-state COVID-19 hospitalizations are near 4,000, the highest level since February, according to the New York State Department of Health. ""It's unlikely that the XBB.1.5 subvariant is solely responsible for the increase in hospitalizations, given recent holiday gatherings and other seasonal factors known to drive up cases each winter,"" said the report. But the increase concerns experts given that the new variant was recently declared the most transmissible yet by the World Health Organization, and also due to New York's track record as a bellwether state for the rest of the country when it comes to COVID-19, it said.

This is ""an ugly reality that follows the end of federal assistance that paid for school meals for more than 50 million students during the pandemic,"" reported USA Today on Friday.

607,Uncertainties linger on amid energy transformation -- a global energy outlook in 2023,"BEIJING, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- In 2022, an energy crisis hit Europe, causing fuel shortages, business closures and economic slowdowns. The impacted countries were prompted to adjust domestic energy policy, and the world is feeling the spillover. Energy uncertainty will remain into 2023, given ongoing geopolitical conflicts, global warming and exchange rate volatility. Moreover, the international energy landscape could be profoundly reshaped. CHAIN REACTION ""The world is in the midst of its first global energy crisis -- a shock of unprecedented breadth and complexity,"" the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its World Energy Outlook 2022 published in October. Due to tightened supplies, international energy prices have been highly volatile since last year. As the Ukrainian crisis escalated last year, the West imposed harsh sanctions on Russia, a major energy producer and exporter, disrupting energy supplies and pushing up prices. In European countries, wholesale prices for electricity and gas have risen five to 15-fold since early 2021, the Brussels-based economic think tank Bruegel said in a report, noting that if governments were to fully cover the cost of price increases for electricity and gas before markets find a new equilibrium at lower prices, it would cost about 1 trillion euros (1.07 trillion U.S. dollars). ""The capacity of government budgets to soften the impact on consumers is limited by the magnitude of existing debt and the volume of the price increases,"" said the report published in September. The crisis has spotlit fragile global supply chains. Due to the sharp decline in gas via pipelines from Russia, European countries have increased liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports but do not have sufficient LNG storage facilities. Europe's dependence on Russian energy will likely remain for a while. In 2021, the European Union imported more than 40 percent of its total gas consumption from Russia, 27 percent of its oil and 46 percent of its coal. Beyond Europe, a worldwide chain reaction is underway. Coal imports into India hit a record high. Economies such as Japan and South Korea are considering a return to nuclear power. Emerging and less developed economies relying on imported energy have had to compete with developed economies for energy at high prices. Meanwhile, U.S. energy exporters have gained huge profits, and regions with high natural gas reserves, such as North Africa, are trying to increase exports. Also a result of the crisis, commodity price volatility increased, with many countries experiencing high inflation. ENERGY PRICES TO STAY HIGH Unless geopolitics and global supply and demand fundamentally change, energy prices will remain high in the short run with tightened supply. In 2023, the EU's potential gas supply-demand gap could reach 27 billion cubic meters, Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, said in December when presenting a report titled ""How to avoid gas shortages in the European Union in 2023."" The shortfall represents about 6.8 percent of the EU's 2023 natural gas baseline demand. In its Oil Market Report in December, the IEA forecasted that the third quarter of 2023 would see a sharp deficit in crude oil. ""As we move through the winter months and towards a tighter oil balance"" in the third quarter of 2023, ""another price rally cannot be ruled out,"" it said. Energy prices are projected to decline 11 percent in 2023 and a further 12 percent in 2024 but will remain more than 50 percent above their five-year average through 2024, the World Bank said in its Commodity Markets Outlook in October. ""Persistently high energy prices will continue to have inflationary implications, particularly through second-round effects such as higher transport and electricity costs for businesses,"" it said. Though natural gas, coal and crude oil prices are expected to lower in 2023 on average, European gas and power markets may be even tighter in 2023, S&P Global Commodity Insights said in its 2023 energy outlook. ""With natural gas prices expected to remain elevated, structural reform of Europe's electricity markets to weaken the link between gas and power prices is high on the agenda for 2023, although there will be significant challenges to achieving such measures,"" it said. In the coming years, global energy supplies will be more unstable, with frequent mild shortages, possibly restricted Russian oil and gas production and exports, a rising share of renewables and a low willingness to invest in fossil fuels due to carbon peaking and carbon neutrality. High energy costs may drive energy-intensive businesses in many European countries to cut, shut down or shift production. ""If energy prices remain as high as they are at present in the long term, this could lead to some industries leaving Germany,"" said Oliver Falck, director of the ifo Center for Industrial Organization and New Technologies in Germany. UNCERTAIN ENERGY TRANSITION Experts said surging prices would force Europe to speed up its energy transition and turn to more green energy, which may not remedy the pressing crisis. As part of its REPowerEU plan launched in March, the EU announced in May an additional investment of 210 billion euros before 2027 toward its green transition, including diversification of energy supplies and an accelerated roll-out of renewable energy to replace fossil fuels. It also proposed increasing its binding energy efficiency target from 9 percent to 13 percent and its targeted percentage of renewable energy sources in the EU's overall energy mix from 40 percent to 45 percent by 2030. The global energy crisis is driving ""a sharp acceleration"" in installations of renewable power, with total capacity growth worldwide set to almost double in 2022-2027 and wind and solar to account for over 90 percent of the renewable power capacity added over the next five years. ""This is a clear example of how the current energy crisis can be a historic turning point towards a cleaner and more secure energy system,"" said Birol, IEA executive director. Although hikes in energy prices may speed up the transition to renewables to some degree, some experts worry that the current crisis might prompt certain countries to rely more on traditional energy instead of less. In 2023, most countries will develop both traditional and new energy to tackle the energy shock, The Economist said in November. ""In the short term they will embrace investment in polluting fossil fuels in return for security,"" it said. ""In the long term they will adopt state-led industrial policy in an attempt to accelerate a renewables build-out.""",Xinhua,2023-01-14 14:38
643,"Easy access to gun, violent media increase risk of child becoming shooter in U.S.: scholars","SYDNEY, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- Children in the United States are being influenced by gun violence depicted in media and easy access to firearms in their homes, which explained the tragedy of a first-grader shooting his teacher in Virginia, according to an analysis published Thursday. In an article released by the media network the Conversation, Brad Bushman, professor from the Ohio State University, and Dan Romer, research director from the University of Pennsylvania, elaborated on the factors regarding how a child in the United States becomes a shooter, after a 6-year-old boy shot a teacher at Richneck Elementary School in Virginia last week. The scholars said acts of gun violence in PG-13 movies have nearly tripled in the 30 years since the rating was introduced in 1984, while another 2019 survey of adults further showed that 12 percent said they were allowed to watch PG-13 movies between the ages of six and nine, with 6 percent saying they watched such films at an even younger age. Violent media can lead children to engage in more dangerous behavior if they find a real gun and desensitize or numb children to violence, increasing the possibility of them imitating the aggressive behaviors they watch and considering such behavior as normal, they warned. Besides, they also noted that the United States has far more civilian-owned guns per capita than any other country in the world, with 120.5 guns per 100 residents. Children are naturally curious, and adults often underestimate their ability to find guns hidden in the home, the scholars said. As every year more than 300 people in the United States are either wounded or killed in unintentional shootings by children, Bushman and Romer urged gun owners to lock away firearms, unloaded and with ammunition stored separately, especially if there are children at home.",Xinhua,2023-01-14 14:39
644,68 bodies recovered from plane crash site in Nepal,"  KATHMANDU, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- A total of 68 bodies had been recovered after a local passenger plane carrying 72 people crashed in the Pokhara region in central Nepal on Sunday, and the effort was continuing to find four others, officials said. ""We have found the dead bodies of 68 people so far,"" Jagannath Niroula, spokesperson of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN), told Xinhua. Ajay KC, police chief of the Kaski district where Pokhara is located, told Xinhua earlier that the bodies were found at the crash site in the Seti River gorge which is over 200 meters deep. Brig. Gen. Krishna Prasad Bhandari, Nepal Army's spokesperson, said many of the bodies were beyond recognition and 80 percent of the plane had been gutted in fire. The rescuers were searching for the remaining bodies, he told Xinhua. Nepali soldiers and police officers are mobilized in the search and rescue effort. The ill-fated ATR-72 plane from Yeti Airlines took off from Kathmandu for Pokhara at 10:30 local time and it lost contact with the air traffic control at 10:50 local time, the CAAN said in a statement.   According to the agency, there were 68 passengers and four crew members aboard the flight, among them 15 foreigners, including five Indians, four Russians, two Koreans and one each from Australia, Ireland, Argentina and France. Prem Nath Thakur, general manager of the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, said the plane had been granted landing clearance before it crashed in the Seti River gorge. The weather seemed not a factor in the accident, as it was ""very good"" in Pokhara from early morning, Thakur told a press conference, noting the pilots did not report technical problems either. Among the passengers aboard the flight, there were three children and three infants, Thakur added. The Nepali cabinet has declared a national mourning on Monday for the victims and decided to form a five-member committee to probe the cause of the accident, Minister for Industry, Commerce and Supplies Abdul Khan told Xinhua. The cabinet also directed airline operators to regularly and mandatorily get their planes checked, the minister said. In May 2022, a passenger plane operated by Tara Air crashed in Nepal's Mustang district, killing all 22 people aboard.",Xinhua,2023-01-16 08:19
742,Hundreds rally in NYC against U.S. war machine,"   NEW YORK, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of protesters from New York City and nearby regions held a rally and a march against U.S. involvement in overseas wars at Times Square on Saturday. The participants spoke against NATO's expansion and called for peace in Ukraine, criticizing U.S. hefty spending on the Ukraine crisis and the White House's announcement to provide Kiev with another Patriot surface-to-air missile battery. ""We're here today because we oppose the endless expansion of NATO, which is not only unnecessary but reckless and proactive,"" said Brian Becker, national director of the ANSWER Coalition, a major anti-war coalition in the United States.   Instead of escalating the war and sending more weapons to Ukraine, the United States should go back to the negotiating table and recognize that Russia has legitimate security concerns, Becker told Xinhua on the sidelines of the rally. ""We're also here today because the United States is spending extra 65 billion U.S. dollars to fund war in Ukraine while there are a million homeless people in America, while our schools are underfunded and many people are going into bankruptcy because they can't pay doctors' bills,"" said Becker, who urged his country to spend that money to help Americans in need rather than funding war and militarism. Initiated by the ANSWER Coalition and The People's Forum, a movement incubator for working class and marginalized communities, the rally is expected to be followed by similar protests in other U.S. cities ahead of Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Monday.",Xinhua,2023-01-16 08:22
740,"Interview: Japan's unilateral radioactive wastewater discharge irresponsible, harmful: green activist","SEOUL, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- Japan's unilateral push to discharge radioactive wastewater from its crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean is irresponsible and harmful, as the Japanese government pursued it without consultations with neighboring countries, a South Korean green activist said. ""It is very concerned that Japan is still unilaterally pushing for the discharge of the Fukushima contaminated water,"" Ahn Jae-hun, energy and climate change director at the Korea Federation for Environment Movement, told Xinhua on Saturday. ""Neighboring countries such as (South) Korea and China could suffer more direct damage, so Japan had to consult with them. The problem is that Japan follows its own process (without consultations),"" said Ahn. ""A sizeable amount of the contaminated water, such as tritium, is difficult to purify no matter how much purification is performed. It is very irresponsible to release it as it is."" Japan's planned release of tritium-laced wastewater from the Fukushima power plant into the sea will start around this spring or summer, according to Kyodo News reports citing the Japanese government. Japan decided in April 2021 to start dumping about 1.25 million tons of nuclear wastewater into the ocean spanning 30 years from 2023. The Japanese government has claimed that the contaminated water could be diluted with water and discharged at a low concentration after being treated with an advanced liquid processing system (ALPS). The green activist, however, noted that the radioactive substances cannot be completely filtered through the ALPS, saying substances, such as tritium, will be poured into the sea unfiltered. ""A lot of radioactive materials have already flowed into the sea after the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Because of that, fish contaminated with cesium are caught in waters off Fukushima,"" said Ahn. According to the South Korean environmental group's analysis of the 2021 data from Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, cesium was detected from 8 percent of Japanese fishery products. ""Once (the contaminated water) is thrown into the sea, it cannot be retrieved. Environmental effects from radioactive materials cannot be felt immediately, but will inevitably appear over a long period of time,"" Ahn said. ""The Pacific Ocean is not the sea of Japan, but the sea of everybody ... Pollutants will flow to neighboring countries in a situation that a lot of radioactive materials have already been released and contaminated (the marine ecosystem),"" said the green activist. The South Korean government, which has opposed the radioactive wastewater dumping by Japan, reiterated its opposition. ""Putting top priority on public health and safety, the government will continue to respond by maintaining its position that the contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant should be safely disposed of in accordance with international standards from the objective and scientific perspectives,"" a South Korean foreign ministry official said Friday.",Xinhua,2023-01-16 09:06
743,Nations rolling out red carpet for Chinese tourists,"  Indonesian Ambassador Djauhari Oratmangun said on Friday that his country welcomes Chinese people to visit after Beijing optimized its COVID-19 response policy. He said that Chinese people who wish to enter Indonesia for purposes such as tourism, government duties, business meetings, purchasing goods and transit are eligible to apply for a visa on arrival, which enables a maximum stay of 60 days. ""Indonesia is wonderful and beautiful, please do come,"" he said, noting that a company based in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, has planned to organize a conference for 200 to 300 people on the Indonesian island of Bali. Earlier this week, Indonesian Minister for Tourism and Creative Economy Sandiaga Uno said at a news briefing in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, that the Southeast Asian country expects at least 253,000 tourists from China this year. Indonesia is among the many countries that have introduced measures to welcome Chinese tourists since China started to implement new measures on crossborder travel on Jan 8. Mbelwa Kairuki, Tanzania's ambassador in Beijing, told China Daily that after three years of waiting, he was glad to welcome Chinese tourists to his homeland, where people can visit Serengeti National Park to see the world's second-largest mammal migration or climb Mount Kilimanjaro, which is also known as the ""rooftop of Africa"". On Monday, Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Health Anutin Charnvirakul and other Thai government officials greeted passengers from China at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport and presented them with gifts and garlands. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said in a speech earlier this month that the presence of Chinese tourists is vital to the country's tourism and economic growth, adding that Cambodia will not follow some other nations in imposing COVID-19 related restrictions on people arriving from China. The Foreign Ministry of the Maldives said in a statement published on its website on Dec 28 that the country welcomes China's refinement of its exit and entry measures and ""is eagerly awaiting to welcome back Chinese tourists to the Maldives"". Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a news briefing earlier that friendly countries with hospitable hosts fill Chinese tourists' hearts with warmth and happiness and will naturally become favored destinations. He also said efforts will be made to make it easier for Chinese tourists to travel to those places, including by increasing the number of direct flights.",China Daily,2023-01-16 09:23
744,Strong explosions rock Ukrainian capital,"KIEV, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- Strong explosions rocked the Ukrainian capital on Saturday morning due to an apparent missile strike by Russian forces, authorities said.

745,"China actively publishing, sharing accurate COVID-related data with world","   China has conducted multiple technological exchanges with the World Health Organization (WHO), and will continue to support the organization in the global effort to combat COVID-19, the head of China's National Health Commission (NHC) told the head of the WHO over the phone on Saturday, as China on the same day published its data of in-hospital COVID-19 deaths after optimizing the country's COVID-19 response last month. As data is the pillar of China's COVID-19 response, there is no reason for the country to hide or deliberately under-report such data, said Chinese epidemiologists. They explained it takes time to generate accurate data, and the government is racing against time in its efforts to provide the public with the accurate data, and this reflects its responsible attitude toward public health. Ma Xiaowei, head of China's NHC, talked over the phonewith WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Saturday, exchanging views on the current COVID-19 prevention and control measures. Ma said that China had shared information with the WHO and other countries since the beginning of the epidemic, was the first to identify the pathogen and share its genetic sequence, and established a mechanism for technical exchanges with the WHO. Since China took the initiative to optimize and adjust its own epidemic prevention and control policies in light of the current situation, the two sides have conducted many technical exchanges, Ma said, adding that China will continue to support the WHO in the fight against COVID-19. Tedros expressed appreciation for China's efforts to maintain long-term technical exchanges and share epidemic information and data with the WHO. ""WHO appreciates this meeting, as well as the public release of information on the overall situation,"" the Geneva-based agency said in a statement. ""Chinese officials provided information to WHO and in a press conference on a range of topics, including outpatient clinics, hospitalizations, patients requiring emergency treatment and critical care, and hospital deaths related to COVID-19 infection,"" the statement continued. China and the WHO have been in close contact since Chinese health authorities last month optimized its COVID-19 response. Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Thursday that China and the international organization held five technical exchanges in the past month. Recently, the WHO has repeatedly called for China to share more data on its COVID-19 situation to better understand the transmission dynamics of the virus on the ground. An expert close to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Chinese CDC), who declined to be named, told the Global Times on Sunday that China has always closely monitored its COVID-19 situation, including COVID-related deaths and the emergence of new variants. After China downgraded its management of COVID-19 from Class A to Class B, the Chinese CDC's information network continued to serve as the main pillar of the whole monitoring system, supported by reports and surveillance data from hospitals, key organizations and key groups, the expert revealed. The expert said that after China optimized its COVID-19 control, cases began to pile up, thus it is hard to obtain an accurate grasp of the death rate during peak infections. Such assessment can be made only after the infection ebbs away, and the current stage should focus on preventing severe and fatal cases. Liang Wannian, head of China's COVID-19 response expert panel under the NHC, said on Wednesdaythat rather than focusing on the death toll in China caused by COVID-19, the priority for the world is to get through the impact of the pandemic. He noted that calculating the specific number of deaths caused by COVID-19 is unfeasible for most countries and regions.    On Saturday, Jiao Yahui, an NHC official, said that a total of 59,938 COVID-related deaths in hospitalswere reported between December 8, 2022 and January 12, 2023. In an interview with the Global Times on Tuesday, an expert close to the WHO said that there were concerns over the definition of death caused by COVID-19 within that organization, and he revealed that China and the WHO are trying to reconcile this issue and they are working on it. China has insisted on classifying deaths of patients with a positive nucleic acid test as COVID-19-related deaths, which is in line with the WHO and international standards, Jiao said on Saturday. She clarified that the causes of COVID-19 deaths are twofold: coronavirus infection leading to respiratory failure and death, or underlying diseases interacting with the coronavirus leading to death, Jiao said. The US Centers for Disease Control noted that deaths are reported as coronavirus disease deaths ""when coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 are reported as a cause that contributed to death on the death certificate."" Jiao also said that both the number of infections and figures of severe cases had already reached a tapering point. The number of severe COVID-19 cases reached a peak on January 5, standing at 128,000, according to Jiao, who also noted that the number was down to 105,000 as of January 12 and that 75.3 percent of beds for severe cases were occupied. The number of visits to China's fever clinics peaked on December 23, 2022, the NHC announced on Saturday. The number totaled 2.87 million that day, according to Jiao. However, some foreign media still questioned the data released on Saturday, saying that it is underreporting as the data was confined within only hospitals. The expert close to the Chinese CDC said that China is also getting to grips with the number of COVID-related deaths beyond hospitals, but due to lack of testing or delayed reporting, the calculation may take longer than those compiled by hospitals. Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese CDC, said last week that right after the pandemic broke out in 2020, the center has continued to analyze excess mortality (which was defined by WHO as the difference in the total number of deaths in a crisis compared to those anticipated under normal conditions], and published the results. He noted that the center is also doing research on excess mortality linked to China's recent exit wave, and will provide information to the public later. ""Data is the pillar that supports our COVID-19 response. China has never stopped or deliberately hidden COVID-19 information from public, [and] the country with vast population needs time and massive, complicated calculations to generate accurate numbers, which shows the government's responsible attitude,"" said the above-quoted anonymous expert.", (Global Times) ,2023-01-16 10:21

Russian cosmonauts Sergei Prokopyev and Dmitry Petelin together with NASA astronaut Francisco Rubio will return to Earth aboard the Soyuz MS-23 in the next weeks, which is supposed to dock to the ISS on Feb. 22, Russia's space agency Roscosmos said in a statement. Last month, astronauts found damage to the outer skin of the instrument-assembly compartment of the Soyuz MS-22 docked to the ISS, which caused a pressure drop in the cooling system. The systems of the ISS and the Soyuz MS-22 are operating normally, but Roscosmos and its partner space agencies have taken measures to ensure the safe return of the crew to Earth in the event of an accident before the arrival of Soyuz MS-23, the statement said.

580,Investigation reveals officials conceal civilian deaths in U.S. drone strike in Kabul,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- A military investigation recently disclosed by U.S. media revealed that U.S. officials knew shortly after a U.S.-launched drone strike in Kabul, Afghanistan in August 2021 in which civilians were killed, but top military officers tried to conceal the facts by making misleading statements in the ensuing weeks.  According to part of a partially redacted investigation report, which the New York Times said in a Jan. 6 report it gained through a lawsuit against the U.S. Central Command, top U.S. commanders in Afghanistan were notified within hours after the Aug. 29, 2021 drone strike near the Kabul International Airport that at least three children were killed. Possible civilian casualties were reported within 20 minutes following the strike by U.S. military analysts, who assessed that at least three children were killed about two to three hours after the attack, the Times reported, citing the investigation. In their sworn statements for the probe, six of the nine witnesses said they learned immediately after the strike that the missile hit an area where there were civilians who might have been killed as a result. In the ensuing weeks, however, top military officials repeatedly refused to confirm the civilian deaths, with the commander of the Central Command, Kenneth McKenzie, saying on the day of the attack that while the ""possibilities"" of civilian casualties were being assessed, there were ""no indications at this time."" Three days after, Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, defended the operation as ""righteous."" It was not until Sept. 17 that McKenzie finally acknowledged that 10 civilians, including seven children, were killed in that botched strike the United States carried out under extreme pressure.  The ill-advised operation was a preemptive move foiling what intelligence personnel claimed to be a plan by the Islamic State's Afghan branch, ISIS-K, to bomb U.S. troops conducting a hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan at the time. Since the attack, multiple outside investigations have found out that the target, Zemari Ahmadi, was not an ISIS member. Quite on the contrary, he was a longtime Afghan contractor working for a California-based aid group. Others killed in the incident were Ahmadi's family members. On that day, Ahmadi was driving his white Toyota Carolla, which U.S. intelligence officers mistakenly believed were loaded with explosives to be used to bomb U.S. troops, to take colleagues to and from work. What were perceived as explosives in the trunk turned out to be jugs of water Ahmadi brought home for the family to drink. ""We now assess that it is unlikely that the vehicle and those who died were associated with ISIS-K or were a direct threat to U.S. forces,"" McKenzie said at the Sept. 17, 2021, press briefing at the Pentagon. ""It was a mistake."" A subsequent review led by the Air Force inspector general, Sami Said, remains classified, the New York Times reported. But Said acknowledged that confirmation bias was an important factor in how Ahmadi became a target, which is a tendency to look for, analyze or remember information in a way that supports an existing belief.  ""When confirmation bias was so deadly in this case, you have to ask how many other people targeted by the military over the years were also unjustly killed,"" Hina Shamsi, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer representing families of victims, was quoted by the Times as saying. She said the investigation gained by the Times ""makes clear that military personnel saw what they wanted to see and not reality, which was an Afghan aid worker going about his daily life."" Emal Ahmadi, Zemari's brother whose toddler Malika was also killed in the strike, told Xinhua in an interview days after the tragedy that the United States launching airstrikes that killed innocent civilians, including children, was heinous war crimes, and that those responsible must be held to account. The Defense Department has said it would not punish those carrying out the strike. It has promised to compensate Zemari's surviving relatives with condolence payments, but none of them have received the monetary assistance so far.",Xinhua,2023-01-16 13:03

582,Japanese public opposes plan to dump radioactive water into sea,"TOKYO, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government's latest radioactive wastewater discharge plan scheduled for this spring or summer is facing an angry backlash among the public, especially those in the fishing industry, who felt uneasy about the decision. The Japanese government on Friday said a controversial plan to release radioactive wastewater from the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan's northeast into the Pacific Ocean will start in the spring or summer. Japan's dumping of the nuclear-contaminated water into the sea is suspected of violating the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, as well as the 1996 protocol to the convention, Masahide Kimura, member of a Japanese anti-nuclear campaign group, told Xinhua. Such a plan also violates the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, as Japan's foreign ministry admitted that the area where the discharge occurred is not of inland waters, Kimura said. Kimura believed that spreading radioactive materials should not be allowed, as only storage is the means of prevention, and efforts should be prioritized to stop the inflow of groundwater and prevent the continued increase of nuclear-contaminated water. Japan's environment ministry has not yet assessed the environmental impact of the decades-long discharge of the nuclear-contaminated water into the North Pacific Ocean, he noted. ""The opposition to the discharge of treated water into the ocean has not changed in the slightest,"" Masanobu Sakamoto, president of the National Fisheries Cooperative Federation of Japan, said in a statement on Friday, demanding a serious response from the government. Government support for the fishing industry is essential to make up for the damage done to its reputation, Takuya Tasso, governor of Japan's Iwate Prefecture, told the press. Despite strengthened information released by the government and Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) since last December, the discharge plan at present has not yet gained the ""full understanding of citizens and fishery stakeholders,"" according to Hiroyuki Uchida, mayor of Iwaki, Fukushima Prefecture. Uchida hoped that the government and TEPCO would earnestly fulfill their original commitment, which meant no disposal of the nuclear-polluted water will be carried out without the understanding of relevant parties. An official with the Miyagi Prefecture Fisheries Co-operative told the press that they will continue to express opposition, ensuring that fishermen do not suffer losses while firmly stating what is necessary to sustain their livelihoods. In fact, the government's plan to dump the contaminated water into the sea has been opposed by civil groups in Japan since it was launched in April 2021. Last September, a joint petition of 42,000 people opposing the discharge plan and demanding other ways to deal with the contaminated water was submitted to TEPCO and Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry by representatives from livelihood co-operative societies in Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures as well as the fisheries association of Miyagi. About 51 percent of respondents were ""against"" and ""relatively opposed"" to the idea of discharging the filtered wastewater into the sea after diluting it to national standards, according to a survey by the country's public broadcaster NHK at the end of 2020. A poll published by the Asahi Shimbun in early 2021 showed that 55 percent surveyed were opposed to the disposal of the nuclear-contaminated water into the sea after treatment.",Xinhua,2023-01-16 14:45
581,"Japanese PM's G7 tour seeks gang-up, growing int'l presence","TOKYO, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has toured five of the Group of Seven (G7) nations at the beginning of the new year, after controversial moves on security policy triggered concerns among its Asian neighbors in December 2022. Scholars warned that the Japanese government should change its ""subordinative"" relationship with the United States and an open diplomacy with Asian neighbors is the foundation of Japan's national security. During his trip to France, Italy, Britain, Canada and the United States on Jan. 9-15, Kishida signed a reciprocal access defence agreement for closer defense and security ties with his British counterpart Rishi Sunak, and issued a joint statement with U.S. President Joe Biden reiterating the Japan-U.S. alliance in the so-called ""Indo-Pacific strategy."" Since Kishida's government updated its security strategy last month in contravention of its exclusively defense-oriented policy, its series of actions have increasingly raised alarms among its Asian neighbors, said local scholars, urging the government to change its relations with the United States from ""subordination"" to ""self-reliance.""  Friday's U.S.-Japan summit, the main focus of Kishida's week-long tour, marked his first Washington visit as the Japanese premier, who attached utmost importance to the debut trip and made ""full preparations"" beforehand. In December last year, Japan approved three updated documents on its security and defense policies, including the new National Security Strategy, the National Defense Strategy, and the Defense Buildup Program, vowing to gain ""counterstrike capability,"" or ""enemy base strike capabilities."" Japan's annual defense outlays are also set to surge. The government intends to secure about 313 billion U.S. dollars in defense spending for the five years from fiscal 2023. Analysts pointed out that the United States in recent years has dominated the Australia-India-Japan-U.S. Quadrilateral in the Asia-Pacific region, peddling the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework while forming cliques and divided camps. Since taking office in October 2021, Kishida's cabinet is so willing to spearhead the expansion of U.S. hegemony in the Asia-Pacific that it courted the United States by arming itself, while relying on the latter for army expansion and war preparation, paving the way for its dream of becoming a military power again. During the U.S.-Japan meeting, the most severe and complex security environment in the Indo-Pacific region was repeatedly brought up. While Kishida explained to Biden the changes in Japan's security policy, the U.S. president ""commended"" Japan's defense upgrade and its ""historic"" defense budget hike. According to the joint statement issued on Friday, the two sides agreed to further strengthen the Japan-U.S. alliance not only in terms of security but also in economic ties to secure their edge on emerging technologies including semiconductors. Prior to the meeting, foreign and defense chiefs from the two sides held 2-plus-2 defense talks, or the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee on Wednesday, vowing to address their ""greatest strategic challenge."" The ministers agreed to strengthen military ties, deepen cooperation regarding Japan's decision to possess counterattack capabilities, expand joint use of U.S. and Japanese facilities and extend the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty into space. Atsushi Koketsu, emeritus professor at Yamaguchi University of Japan, said the Japanese government, following the U.S. intention, has turned to a ""preemptive attack strategy"" by abandoning the ""exclusive defense"" concept, putting its Asian neighbors on alert. Kishida's practice of ""free riding"" on the U.S. hegemony has roused discontent among the Japanese public.  As the current G7 chair, Japan will host the group's summit in May. Kishida's visit to the five G7 countries is also aimed at garnering support on a host of issues including food security, nuclear disarmament, climate change and Russia-Ukraine conflict before the summit in Hiroshima. Since last October, four ministers have resigned successively from Kishida's cabinet due to scandals, plunging the government's approval ratings to record lows. Meanwhile, former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga criticized Kishida recently for remaining as the head of a political faction within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party while leading the country, an additional blow to Kishida. As multiple crises unfold, Kishida intends to take advantage of Japan's G7 presidency, as well as its election as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council and the council's rotating president in January, to engage in vigorous diplomacy and create a sense of presence by forming cliques, in a bid to ensure a successful G7 Hiroshima summit and boost his flagging approval ratings. During the visit, the Kishida government, abandoner of its exclusively defense-oriented policy and pacifism embodied in the Constitution of Japan, is seeking to strengthen defense and security cooperation with the United States and European countries wherever possible. In London, for example, Kishida and Sunak signed the Japan-Britain Reciprocal Access Agreement aimed at facilitating bilateral defense and security cooperation, stating simplified procedures for Japan-Britain cooperation in ship berthing and joint exercises in the future, and expecting more active military cooperation between the two countries. Liu Di, a professor at Japan's Kyorin University, said Japan's economy has been stagnant for the past 30 years and it will inevitably lead to a host of domestic conflicts if the world's third largest economy continues to hike defense spending. Therefore, Japan may use external forces to strengthen its comprehensive security capabilities, including leveraging other developed countries within the G7 framework, the scholar said. Ukeru Magosaki, a former Japanese foreign ministry official, told Xinhua that the economic weather in Japan is not optimistic, and most Japanese people do not approve of raising taxes or issuing government bonds to increase defense expenditure.

""Even if U.S. primacy was once a source of regional stability, there is little basis to think it will promote harmony today,"" said the article. Two of the most recent U.S. presidents -- Barack Obama and Donald Trump -- charged themselves with the task of ""indefinitely propping up the sun,"" and President Joe Biden has picked up where both presidents left off, according to the article. ""Biden has increased the U.S. military buildup, facilitated a regional military buildup, and attempted to assemble the beginnings of an anti-Chinese containment coalition along with local Asian powers,"" it said. These choices go against what the preservation of peace demands. Kneecapping China's economy, engaging in an endless arms race, aligning with regional countries to encircle Beijing, and alienating smaller countries by demanding that they choose between China and the United States might give Washington more short-term power in Asia, according to the article. ""But these are the ingredients of regional fracture and eventual war, not stability. The United States' Asia policy, then, is at an unacknowledged crossroads. Washington can support regional peace or pursue regional primacy, but it cannot do both,"" it added.",Xinhua,2023-01-17 15:51

598,EU vows to protect competitiveness from U.S. Inflation Reduction Act,"   BRUSSELS, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of the European Union (EU) on Tuesday vowed to take measures to protect the competitiveness of the bloc's member states from the United States' Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) while trying to avoid falling into a subsidy war with Washington. The EU member states' economy and finance ministers discussed the matter on the margins of the year's first Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin). European Commissioner for Economy Paolo Gentiloni underlined the need to address the effects of the IRA on the EU's already strained economy but warned against a subsidy war.   ""We have to strengthen our competitiveness ... It's not about a subsidy war with other countries or U.S., it's about strengthening Europe's competitiveness,"" he said ahead of the meeting. The EU has to work on streamlining its state aid rules, according to Gentiloni, especially for sectors that are crucial for clean technologies and innovation. In parallel, the bloc should be funding common projects, he said, as these will strengthen its competitiveness without undermining its internal market. EU leaders and industries have voiced their concerns over the IRA, which contains provisions that could have significant repercussions on the competitiveness and investment decisions of the EU industry, in particular as regards sectors crucial for its transition to a green economy.   Signed in mid-August last year, the IRA targets a record 369 billion U.S. dollars of spending on climate and energy provisions. The landmark package comprises tax credits for electric cars made in North America and supports U.S. battery supply chains. Since then, a joint high-level task force has been established to address the EU's request to be treated ""fairly,"" like other U.S. trade partners, such as Canada or Mexico. Sweden's Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson said on Tuesday after a meeting with fellow ministers from the EU that the member states will continue to discuss their response to measures the United States has taken to stimulate green technology investments, which are seen to disadvantage European companies.   Later the same day, European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis was meeting U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai to discuss the matter. ""We're working through the task force, but we're also doing outreach at other levels to address those concerns. We know that on the U.S. side there are some delays in the sense of implementing guidelines. This gives us a bit more time for discussion on some elements,"" Dombrovskis said. However, the task force is not likely to solve all the problems. French President Emmanuel Macron has been pushing for a ""Made in Europe"" strategy, in which critical sectors would be subsidized to counter the U.S. subsidies.",Xinhua,2023-01-18 08:24
595,U.S. politicians fortify schools rather than regulate guns: article,"   NEW YORK, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- The vast and unchecked personal arsenals of guns in the United States have given Americans a shameful distinction: it is the only developed nation that now teaches its kindergartners how to wait in line for the bathroom and hide under desks for a mass shooting, said an article published by The Atlantic-Journal Constitution on Monday. School shootings climbed to the highest number in two decades in 2020-2021, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. In 2020, guns became the leading cause of death among children, adolescents and teens, surpassing car crashes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""When will the shock of gunshots in school be enough to inspire the action necessary to prevent guns in schools and the shattering of lives it causes?"" asked Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, after a school shooting in Virginian earlier this month. ""The silence of politicians around stronger gun laws suggests this latest round of gunfire in a classroom will not lead to real preventive measures,"" said the article. The United States leads the world in firearms per capita with more guns than people, the article said, quoting the Small Arms Survey. According to the survey, American civilians own more than 393 million guns, 120.48 guns per 100 U.S. residents, but ""we are not safer.""",Xinhua,2023-01-18 09:07

""Dialogue and negotiation is the only realistic and feasible way to resolve the crisis,"" Dai Bing, China's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, told the Security Council briefing on Ukraine. ""Since the outbreak of the crisis in Ukraine, problems have emerged on all fronts, and the confrontations and conflicts between religions, cultures, and societies have been deepening.

""China hopes that all parties concerned will exercise rationality and restraint, engage in dialogue, and commit themselves to resolving common security concerns by political means,"" he said. ""The international community should focus on promoting peace talks, encouraging Russia and Ukraine to return to negotiations, and accumulating conditions of an early ceasefire and cessation of hostilities,"" he added. ""Any incitement of hatred and inflammation of tensions should be rejected. In this process, religion should become a positive force in advocating peace and promoting unity, and build peace in the minds of the local people,"" said Dai. Turning to religious issues in conflict situations, the envoy said that ""we have seen that in some conflict areas, religious issues, if not handled properly, tend to intensify conflicts, and are not conducive to resolving hatred and achieving reconciliation."" ""China has always maintained that the freedom of religion and belief should be fully protected and respected, and that exchanges between religions and sects should be strengthened, mutual respect fostered, and the peace of culture advocated, so as to inject positive energy into the political settlement of hot spot issues,"" the envoy noted. According to Dai, at the open meeting on Ukraine held in the council last week, many countries stressed that 2023 should be a year of peace. ""This is also China's strong wish,"" he said. ""China will continue to uphold an objective and impartial position, and work with all peace-loving countries to build international synergy and play a constructive role in a peaceful resolution of the crisis in Ukraine.""",Xinhua,2023-01-18 13:22

""After two years of the (COVID) pandemic, we are ready for Chinese tourists and I hope Chinese tourists will arrive at least in the same numbers as before,"" Julius Buday told Xinhua. ""When we walked the streets of Bratislava's Old Town in 2019, we met throngs of Chinese tourists,"" he said. Back then, China was the sixth largest source of tourists to Slovakia. Just like their peers from other countries, tourists from China tend to spend two nights on average in the capital of Slovakia, ""which is why we are trying to promote Bratislava as a 72-hour city,"" he said. On average, Chinese tourists spend about 200 euros (218 U.S. dollars) per day in Slovakia. Their recent absence has had a substantial negative impact on the country's economy, Buday said. Renata Michalikova, a city guide in Bratislava, told Xinhua that most of the Chinese tourists were young people or families on a tour of Europe. ""They liked the city for being small and compact with everything close at hand.

751,"High consumption, past policies, U.S. sanctions lead to Iran's gas shortage","TEHRAN, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- High domestic consumption, ineffective policies of the past and the U.S. sanctions are among the factors behind the recent gas shortage in Iran that led to nationwide closures over the previous days, according to Iranian analysts and media. Iran, which has the second-largest gas reserves in the world behind Russia, has experienced a gas shortage since the start of the winter. While most Iranian provinces had sub-zero temperatures, the Iranian government had to temporarily shut down factories, companies, as well as schools and colleges in a number of cities from Saturday to Monday in order to keep people's homes warm.  In an analysis piece, the news website Shahrara News wrote that gas consumption by the residential as well as trade and industrial sectors in Iran has surpassed 700 million cubic meters (mcm) per day this winter, indicating a 150-mcm increase year on year. It said the figure is 6.7 times higher than the global per capita and three times more than that of the entire consumption by the European Union states. According to the Iranian Oil Ministry, the country's current daily gas production stands at close to 1 billion cubic meters, of which only 850 mcm remain after the separation of gas condensate. Iran's daily gas consumption reaches between 650 mcm and 750 mcm during winter, leading to an imbalance of 200 mcm in the gas network, according to the analysis. In a separate analysis of the country's energy status quo, the news website Didban Iran wrote that statistics hint at an absence of principled energy production and consumption planning in Iran in the previous years, also blaming ""bad consumption"" as one of the main reasons for the current energy shortage.  Experts said that some ineffective policies implemented in the past were one of the reasons. Morteza Behrouzifar, an energy expert, told Iranian Students' News Agency (ISNA) that during the past years, diversifying the energy basket has not received due attention in Iran, and fuel storage has also been almost neglected likewise. During the 1980s, Iran decided to use gas as the main fuel for domestic consumption as the country had abundant gas reserves and did not seek to export them, the expert noted. The majority of the industries developed in Iran during those years and the following years required big amounts of energy to run, said Behrouzifar, adding the policy seemed quite logical until the time arrived when the country failed to optimize domestic energy consumption and increase production proportionately. Speaking to ISNA, another energy expert Mehdi Hasehmzadeh also hinted at insufficient attention to gas storage in the past years, regretting that two Iranian companies involved in the field of gas storage were dissolved in 2016, and no other company is currently active in the area. Between 2005 and 2013, the Iranian government increased the number of the cities and villages connected to the nationwide gas network from 600 to 1,000 and from 2,080 to over 14,000 respectively, Khabar Online news agency wrote in another analysis. During the same period, the then-Iranian government increased the number of industrial units using natural gas as feedstock from 9,500 to 58,000. However, paying insufficient attention to using other energies for development is one of the main reasons for the current gas shortage.  In their analyses of the country's current circumstances, a lot of Iranian media blamed the U.S. sanctions, reimposed on Iran's oil and banking sector following Washington's withdrawal from a 2015 nuclear deal in May 2018, as the main culprit for the current imbalance in the gas sector. Khabar Online wrote that Iran needs 160 billion U.S. dollars in investments to renovate its oil wells, which have deteriorated and sustained damage over the past few years. The U.S. sanctions have impeded both the flow of foreign funds and the transfer of technology to Iran, which needs to import modern technologies to boost its gas production, according to Khabar Online. Behrouzifar said the lifting of U.S. sanctions is a long-term cure for Iran's domestic gas industry. The U.S. sanctions not only have affected Iran's gas production capacity but also its gas distribution infrastructure, Didban Iran quoted Ali Jabal-Ameli, a financial market expert, as saying.",Xinhua,2023-01-18 14:03

Black children and those in low-income households were at greater risk, according to the University of Missouri-led study. ""We found a significant increase in pediatric firearm injury rates during the pandemic compared to the five preceding years,"" lead study author Mary Bernardin was quoted by news portal HealthDay as saying. ""The escalation in injuries was driven by a significant increase in firearm assaults and homicides, as well as increased frequency of innocent children injured as bystanders amidst adult crime,"" Bernardin said in a university news release. For the study, the researchers compared records of pediatric firearm injuries treated at St. Louis Children's Hospital from March 2015 to February 2020 to those treated between March 2020 through March 2022. In the earlier period, there were 413 pediatric firearm injuries, compared to 259 during the pandemic study period, with the monthly injury rate rising 52 percent from an average of 6.8 shootings per month to 10.3 per month during the pandemic. In addition, pediatric firearm deaths rose 29 percent during the pandemic, according to the study.",Xinhua,2023-01-18 14:18

""Iran's fuel offer is still existing, but the U.S. has been preventing Lebanon from accepting it,"" Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised speech. Nasrallah called on Hezbollah's rivals supported by the United States in Lebanon to obtain a sanctions waiver from Washington. ""We have an opportunity to solve the fuel crisis, and you, America's allies, must benefit from your relationship with the U.S. to bring an exception for Lebanon to receive the Iranian fuel,"" Nasrallah said. According to Nasrallah, Lebanon's access to Iranian fuel would allow the country to secure four hours of power supply on a daily basis for six months to help solve the electricity crisis in the country. Hezbollah is a Lebanese armed group and political party backed by Iran. In September 2022, Iran said it was prepared to provide Lebanon with 660,000 tonnes of gasoline as a ""gift"" to ease electricity cuts in the crisis-hit country. However, the United States later warned that Lebanon might be subject to U.S. sanctions if it imports Iranian oil. Lebanon has suffered for decades from power outages.

571,Australian general practice system in worst state in 40 years: health minister,"CANBERRA, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Health Minister Mark Butler has flagged a major overhaul of the country's universal health care scheme. Butler recently said that general practice in Australia is in the worst shape since the introduction of Medicare in 1984 as an aging population increases pressure on the health system. Along with medical and patient groups, Butler has undertaken a review of Medicare which will be published within weeks. General practitioners (GPs) have warned that a lack of government support has forced them to close practices or charge more, with current Medicare rebates not sufficient to cover the cost of seeing patients. Butler said there were also structural issues with the Medicare system such as poor digital connections between primary health, hospitals and aged and disability care facilities. ""Frankly, I think our general practice system right now is in the worst shape it has been in, in the 40-year history of Medicare,"" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) on Tuesday. ""We're seeing it across the developed world. But there are particular challenges here in Australia that we are determined as a new government to fix.""

574,UK inflation eases slightly to 10.5 pct in December: ONS,"   LONDON, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom's (UK) inflation slowed for a second month in December 2022, but the cost-of-living crisis continued as food inflation remained record high, official figures showed on Wednesday. The consumer price index (CPI) rose at an annual rate of 10.5 percent in December, falling from 10.7 percent in November and a 41-year peak of 11.1 percent in October, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. ""Prices at the pump fell notably in December, with the cost of clothing also dropping slightly,"" ONS Chief Economist Grant Fitzner said. ""However, this was offset by increases for coach and air fares as well as overnight hotel accommodation. Food costs continue to spike, with prices also rising in shops, cafes and restaurants,"" he said.   The annual inflation rate for transport was 6.9 percent in December, down for a sixth consecutive month, and the main driver behind the easing came from motor fuels, the ONS said. Food and non-alcoholic beverage prices continued to rise, up by 16.9 percent in the 12 months to December, the highest rate since 1977. The annual rate of inflation for this category has risen for 17 consecutive months. ""These figures add to a growing body of evidence that the UK has passed peak inflation. Over the coming year, inflation should fall further towards single digits,"" Alpesh Paleja, lead economist of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said. But the cost-of-living crisis will continue to be a very real problem for both households and businesses, as price pressures remain high in the short term, Paleja added.   ""Inflation remains particularly high for low-income families, who are on the wrong side of a large cost-of-living gap due to the high cost of energy and food,"" said Jack Leslie, senior economist at the think tank Resolution Foundation. An analysis conducted by the Resolution Foundation showed that the poorest tenth of UK families experienced an inflation rate of 11.9 percent compared to only 9.2 percent for the richest tenth. The falling inflation rate will also come as a relief to the Bank of England, whose policymakers may see this as an opportunity to slow the pace of further interest rate rises, Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said. ""With the effects of past rate rises still passing through the UK economy, we could see the base interest rate peak at 4 percent in the first quarter of the year,"" he said.

""For 2023, we're not expecting a better situation than for 2022. Some of the shortcomings in the global supply chains that we have seen in 2022 will have an impact in 2023,"" IFAD President Alvaro Lario told Xinhua. ""We are working with many of our partners in seeing how to also unlock the fertilizer situation. However, for 2023 given the planting season in 2022, there will be not much of good news,"" he said.  The president said that although action is being taken to address the food crisis, it is barely enough and more investments will be needed. ""We're seeing many of the smallholders suffer because of the cost-of-living crisis, the limited access to food and fertilizers. Unfortunately, the planting season has been lost,"" he said. ""However, there are several ongoing initiatives on how to address the shortcomings of food systems. Some of them relate to taxation, subsidies, distribution and production. We're looking into ways to increase in a massive way the investments that go into food systems,"" he said. According to IFAD, three-quarters of the poorest people in the world live in the rural areas of developing countries. Most of them depend on agriculture for their livelihood. Climate change, a growing global population, and volatile food and energy prices have the potential to push millions more vulnerable people into extreme poverty and hunger by 2030. According to the ""State of Food Security and Nutrition"" report published by five UN agencies, including IFAD, last July, the world is falling further behind in efforts to end hunger and poverty in line with the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It showed that the number of people affected by hunger globally rose to 828 million in 2021, an increase of about 150 million since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Lario also said that China could serve as an example of how to eradicate absolute poverty. ""China is a big partner for us at IFAD,"" he said. As both a borrowing and a donor country, China has played ""a fundamental role"" in the south-south triangular cooperation, said the IFAD chief. South-South cooperation refers to development cooperation between developing countries in the Global South. When such cooperation involves support from a Northern partner, it is referred to as Triangular cooperation. ""Given what China has experienced over the last decades, they are really a good example of how to lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. We still work with China on rural poverty, and they have been a fundamental actor for us,"" said Lario.

551,IAEA completing stationing of missions at Ukraine's nuclear plants,"KIEV, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is finalizing the stationing of permanent missions at Ukrainian nuclear power plants (NPPs), the Ukrainian government press service reported Wednesday. While speaking at a joint briefing with IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said that the mission at Khmelnytsky NPP in western Ukraine is to start working in the coming days. ""Today, I heard from Director General Rafael Grossi assurances of full support from the IAEA for our efforts to ensure nuclear safety, including at the Zaporizhzhia NPP,"" Shmyhal said. ""We are working on the issue of organizing a safety zone around the Zaporizhzhia NPP, and we are making progress on this matter,"" Grossi was quoted by the Interfax-Ukraine news agency as saying. According to an IAEA statement issued on Tuesday, the experts will monitor key nuclear safety and security systems, provide technical assistance, assess the plants' needs and report to the IAEA headquarters. ""With IAEA teams permanently present at all of Ukraine's NPPs and the Chornobyl site, the Agency will have around 11-12 staff simultaneously on the ground in the country, an unprecedented undertaking by the organization,"" the international nuclear watchdog said in the statement. On Jan. 16, the IAEA established its mission at the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. There are five nuclear power plants in Ukraine, four of which are functioning. The Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which witnessed a nuclear disaster on April 26, 1988, was completely shut down on Dec. 15, 2000.

553,"U.S. hits debt ceiling, Treasury Department takes ""extraordinary measures""","  WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States hit its debt limit on Thursday, prompting the Treasury Department to take ""extraordinary measures"" to continue financing the federal government. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen announced in a letter to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy that her department would put the temporary brakes on new investments in a few government retirement funds, from Thursday until June 5. Those include the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund and a couple of others. Yellen said such moves could allow the federal government to pay its bills until June. At the same time, Yellen said there would be ""considerable uncertainty"" around those actions, should Congress fail to pass legislation to increase the 31.4 trillion U.S. dollar debt ceiling. According to the Government Accountability Office, U.S. lawmakers have increased the nation's debt ceiling 22 times since 1997. Republicans, who now control the House by a slim margin, want to tie any debt-raising legislation to spending cuts. This occurs at a time when the U.S. government has spent so much that it has sparked the worst inflation in four decades. Many economists have blasted the recently-passed omnibus bill, worth 1.7 trillion U.S. dollars, as loaded with frivolous spending. The White House said it would not compromise on raising the debt ceiling. Failing to increase the debt ceiling could lead to a default on U.S. debt that could unleash economic calamity worldwide.

In the Ile-de France region where Paris is situated, the public transport sector reduced the frequency of metros and tramways. On Jan. 10, French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne laid out details of the country's controversial pension reform plan, which would progressively raise the legal retirement age gradually by three months a year from 62 to 64 years by 2030 and would put in place a guaranteed minimum pension. Borne told a press conference that starting from 2027, people will have to work 43 years to qualify for a full pension. In 2019, demonstrations were also held in France against the pension reform, but then only 800,000 people participated, according to the Interior Ministry.        ",Xinhua,2023-01-20 09:01

The need to repair these divisions is especially acute, a recent report by the American magazine Vanity Fair has said.

560,"Experts at Davos urges energy supply security, green transition","   DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) -- Energy experts at the World Economic Forum (WEF) have emphasized the importance of securing energy supply and the green transition in tackling the energy crisis and building a clean, sustainable future. The current energy crisis is not the first for some countries, but it is the first at a truly global level, due to the interconnection of energy markets. Soaring global prices for oil, natural gas and coal have hit consumers hard, combined with rising inflation and disruptions in supply chains at a time when the world was already recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. The issue of how to achieve geopolitical stability and energy security was discussed this week at the WEF, which is currently meeting in Davos, Switzerland. Leaders said that the energy crisis comes after a decade of under-investment in legacy energy sources, as well as slow investment in renewables.   The world ""has never seen an energy crisis of this depth and complexity,"" said Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA). However, he underlined that the global energy emergency has boosted renewable energies, which in turn will reinforce energy security. Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud emphasized the need for near-term stability, especially in the world's energy markets. Geopolitical stability is ""absolutely key"" to global energy security, he said. ""In the meantime, we need to maintain a supply of traditional energies that are priced in a way that ensures stability -- and we will continue to address this in a responsible way,"" Faisal said. Energy leaders also highlighted the importance of the ""Green transition"", calling for the development of renewable energy in order to ensure supply and fight climate change. Globalization was also emphasized as part of the green transition. Adam Tooze, director of the European Institute at Columbia University, said that ""the energy transition is effectively a set of interdependencies."" Meanwhile, Birol said that ""the biggest driver of renewable energy growth today is energy security."" In a recent report, the IEA said the world was at the dawn of a new industrial age of clean energy technology manufacturing, and this is creating major new markets and millions of jobs. However, it is also creating new risks, prompting countries across the globe to devise industrial strategies to secure their place in the new global energy economy. The IEA estimates that the market for mass-produced green energy will be worth about 650 billion U.S. dollars annually by 2030, more than triple its current value. Faisal said Saudi Arabia is ""investing almost 200 billion U.S. dollars in renewable energy at home and abroad"" as it brings online more low-carbon technologies. Many expect key technologies, including wind, solar, batteries, carbon capture and storage (CCS), and hydrogen infrastructure, to continue growing this year as countries look for alternative energy sources.   China's efforts to push forward the development of renewable energy were underlined at the WEF this week. IEA Chief Fatih Birol told Xinhua on the sidelines of the Forum that China has a leading role to play in green technologies. ""China today is the biggest driver of clean energy technologies,"" he said, adding that it is the global leader in solar, wind, electric cars and new nuclear facilities. According to the report ""Energy Technology Perspectives 2023"" released by the IEA recently, China currently dominates the manufacturing and trade of most clean energy technologies, and its investment in the sector has been instrumental in bringing down costs worldwide for key technologies.",Xinhua,2023-01-21 09:10

""There are good reasons for the delivery, there are good reasons against it,"" the country's Minister of Defense Boris Pistorius said on Friday after meeting his U.S. and European counterparts in Ramstein, Germany. Pistorius said that his ministry would check the country's stocks of the Leopard tank for possible delivery to Ukraine in the next few weeks. ""We are preparing for all eventualities,"" he said. The delivery of lighter Marder infantry fighting vehicles, announced in early December 2022, has been criticized by some as inadequately prepared. According to the Ministry of Defense (BMVg), it was unclear at the time where the vehicles would come from. Instead of Leopard tanks, Pistorius announced further deliveries of Marder and Gepard tanks as well as a Patriot surface-to-air missile system. With this, the value of Germany's military support for Ukraine is to reach 3.3 billion euros (3.6 billion U.S. dollars). The United States, meanwhile, has increased its support to Ukraine by 2.5 billion U.S. dollars to 26.7 billion U.S. dollars. The new package includes 59 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. Other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), such as Poland, have reiterated their intention to supply Ukraine with Leopard tanks from their own stocks. However, this would require the approval of the manufacturing country, Germany, which has not yet decided on this matter. Russia has repeatedly said that the supply of Western weapons to Ukraine does not help resolve the conflict but prolongs the suffering of the Ukrainian people.

The Treasury said while it expects the economy to grow 6.1 percent in 2023 and maintain that momentum over the medium-term, global uncertainties could impact growth. ""There is the possible worsening of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which heightens the risk of oil and commodity price volatility, elevated inflationary pressures and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" it said in a proposed Budget Policy Statement for 2023 issued on Thursday. It added that tightening the global monetary policy, especially in the United States, could increase volatility in the financial markets, hurting the local currency. For the first time in five years, Kenya's inflation rate, which stood at 9.1 percent in December 2022, remains above the government target of 5 percent, mainly driven by supply-side constraints occasioned by external shocks and climate-related food and energy prices.

""A truly historical, ground-breaking, and landmark agreement,"" said Jane Nelson, director of the Corporate Responsibility Initiative at Harvard Kennedy School, on Thursday of the recent UN biodiversity deal. Under the leadership of China, the deal, entitled Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, was adopted at the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP15) to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity last month, setting four long-term goals for 2050 and 23 global targets over the decade to 2030 for preserving nature. According to the targets set by the framework, by 2030, at least 30 percent of degraded terrestrial, inland water and coastal and marine ecosystems will be under effective restoration.

532,"Global economy facing ""turning point"" amid challenges","  DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- The global economy has regained steam after a difficult COVID-19 pandemic, but experts at the World Economic Forum (WEF) say a recovery is far from certain. Under the theme ""Cooperation in a Fragmented World,"" the WEF's 2023 annual meeting concluded here on Friday. The gathering came amid unprecedented global challenges such as high inflation, an energy crisis, climate change and geopolitical conflict. Growth is on an upward trajectory and could witness a more robust recovery in 2023 through global cooperation and following China's adjusted COVID-19 response measures.   CAUTION STILL NEEDED The global economic outlook is not as bad as feared a couple of months ago, ""but less bad doesn't quite yet mean good,"" Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), told a closing panel at the WEF. ""We have to be cautious."" Georgieva said headline inflation was heading down. China's optimized COVID-19 response is expected to boost global growth, with the IMF forecasting the Chinese economy will reach an estimated 4.4 percent, far outpacing global growth. Signs of declining inflation, resilient consumer spending and strong labor markets, among others, suggest that growth could rebound in the short term. ""Be careful not to get on the other side of the spectrum, from being too pessimistic to being too optimistic. Stay in the middle of realism that seems to serve the world well,"" Georgieva said. The WEF issued its Global Risks Report 2023, saying that conflict and geo-economic tensions have triggered a series of deeply interconnected global risks, with the cost of living crisis being the most significant short-term risk. At the same time, climate change and climate adaptation are the most considerable long-term concern. Georgieva said that future growth prospects depend on how supply chain security is managed. ""If we diversify rationally, the cost of this adjustment would be low -- we put it down to 0.2 percent of GDP. If we trash trade that has been an engine for growth for so many decades, the cost can go up to 7 percent loss of GDP, equaling 7 trillion U.S. dollars,"" she said. ""Labor markets are holding firm so far, but interest rates are yet to bite, and if they bite more severely, then we can see unemployment going up. And it is very different for a consumer to have a cost of living crisis and a job than the cost of living crisis and no job,"" Georgieva said. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde was also cautious about the global economic outlook. ""The greatest tragedy in this moment would be if central banks were to lurch away from a focus on assuring price stability prematurely, and we were to have to fight this battle twice,"" said former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. Despite recent signs of improvement, ""relief must not become complacency,"" Summers noted.   i) COOPERATION BRINGS OPTIMISM Attendees at the forum said cooperation would be for global growth. WEF President Borge Brende expressed confidence that ""we can shape a more resilient, sustainable and equitable future,"" but ""the only way to do it is together."" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for urgent action on several interconnected challenges, including the global economic crisis and climate. He underlined the need to ""forge the pathways to cooperation in our fragmented world."" Leslie Maasdorp, vice president and chief financial officer of the New Development Bank, told Xinhua, ""Without multilateral cooperation, you cannot really deal with challenges that are cross-national ... I believe that the one positive lesson we can learn from COVID is that we are interconnected."" Though challenges still threaten the global economy, attendees voiced hope that a severe recession may be avoided. ""We are now heading to a year where hopefully the corporates, the consumers, the state, policymakers will continue to have that resilient, determined approach to engineer the transitions that must take place,"" Lagarde said. ""The situation around the world must be improving a little bit,"" said Lagarde. ""Players are moving from defense mode, that they had effectively been in 2021 and 2022, towards a more competitive mode."" In his closing remarks on Friday, Brende said despite the many complex issues facing the global community, progress had been made at the annual meeting, especially in tackling the most urgent crises of food, energy and climate. ""For me, the greatest lesson of the week has been that although the world is more fragmented today, it does not need to be tomorrow,"" Brende said. EXPECTATIONS FOR CHINA Business leaders worldwide have been pessimistic about the global economy in recent months, but now, cautious optimism is emerging. They are confident about the robust growth of the Chinese economy and expect China to be a ""key driver"" of a global recovery.   China's economy posted steady growth in 2022 despite pressures including COVID-19 breakouts and a complex external environment, with its gross domestic product growing 3 percent year on year to a record high of 121.0207 trillion yuan (about 17.95 trillion U.S. dollars) in 2022, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed. The 2022 GDP growth was published at the time when the WEF was underway. With the better-than-expected data, optimism over both the Chinese and global economies spread in Davos. Maasdorp was confident in China's expected growth, a sentiment shared across the banking sector. Although he predicted a ""bumpy period"" in the first quarter of this year and potentially in the second, there are strong expectations for more robust growth driven by consumption in the year's second half. Haitham Al Ghais, secretary general of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, praised China for factoring renewable energy into its growth strategy. ""We are extremely proud of the steps taken by the Chinese government to promote renewable energy as a part of the energy mix as required for China to fuel its continuous development and economic growth,"" he said. ""We are very confident in the Chinese economy and the strength of the leadership and the government and the people of China,"" Al Ghais said.",Xinhua,2023-01-22 09:39
533,"Chinese Lunar New Year celebrated in Serbia with grand gala, fireworks","BELGRADE, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- With fireworks, lion dance, and a festival of tastes, Serbians and overseas Chinese welcomed the Chinese Lunar New Year in Belgrade on Saturday. The central celebration welcoming the Year of the Rabbit held at the Kalemegdan Fortress in Belgrade gathered several hundreds of people, including Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic and the Chinese Ambassador to Serbia Chen Bo, who were all entertained by lion dancers who just flew here from China. ""We are (the Lion Dance team) from the Dong Fang Wu Shu School in Dongming County, Shandong Province, and we came to Serbia to show our traditional Chinese culture and bring a lot of flavors of the Chinese New Year to Serbia,"" Yang Zhengqiang, one of the lion dancers told Xinhua. At the beginning of the celebration, Brnabic said that the New Year celebrations across the country display the love of the Serbian people towards the Chinese. ""On behalf of our people I wish you (China and Chinese people) good health, luck, and many new economic achievements,"" she said, pledging to further strengthen the ""iron-clad friendship"" between China and Serbia. She thanked China's support to Serbia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the selfless support and assistance amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Chen said that this traditional cultural manifestation is the embodiment of the ""iron-clad friendship"" between the two peoples, who, although geographically far away, are getting closer. ""In the past year, we jointly built a fast railway, highways, opened new factories and started direct flights, and increased bilateral trade. We strive towards economic development and a better life, while the friendship between people represents a foundation for our cooperation in all areas,"" Chen said. After the speeches, the gathered people counted the seconds until the grandiose fireworks announced midnight in Beijing, China, and later marched to the Republic Square, where the Festival of Tastes of the Belt and Road is being held, with traditional food from the countries that participated in the Belt and Road Initiative. ""This is not my first time trying Chinese food -- I love it very much. We were late for the fireworks, but the children loved the lion dance,"" said one young mother who brought her two children to the festival. Manuela, a tourist from Germany said that she liked the festival and was ""super happy"" to celebrate with Chinese and Serbian people. ""I was super excited because this is my first time seeing the Chinese New Year celebration and the lion dance, as well as a little Kong Fu show,"" said the German girl, who is also practicing Kung Fu (martial arts). Ana Leginj who came from the vicinity of Novi Sad, Serbia's second-largest city, just to attend the celebration for the first time. ""It was phenomenal, especially the lion dance, it is really nicely imagined, together with the culinary offer,"" she said. The message ""Happy Chinese New Year"" was broadcast from the Belgrade Tower, the tallest building in this part of the Balkans. Besides Belgrade, the celebration of the Chinese Lunar New Year will be held in Serbia's other large cities. The festivities in Serbia, held here for the fifth consecutive year -- will continue until Jan. 26.",Xinhua,2023-01-22 10:00
535,Experts highlight challenges in fighting COVID-19 at WEF,"GENEVA, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) -- Public health experts and officials attending the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting 2023 have cautioned against some major challenges in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, as Omicron variants are still spreading rampantly worldwide. They emphasized the impact of long COVID, vaccine inequality and pandemic-related misinformation at the meeting held at Davos, Switzerland. PANDEMIC ""FAR FROM OVER"" While the COVID situation has been better than that in the early stages, Michelle Williams, dean of the faculty at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, warned at the WEF that the ""bottom line is this pandemic is far from over."" Williams said that there are still 526 deaths per day from COVID-19 across the United States, up from about 400 per day in October last year. ""What's really disappointing is nine out of 10 of those deaths could be averted,"" if vaccines and boosters would have been taken, and other behavioral aspects, such as ventilation, mask-wearing, and appropriate social distancing practised, Williams said. ""So for me as a public health person, knowing that we could avert nine out of 10 of those deaths reminds me of the fact that we have to avoid prematurely talking about this pandemic being over,"" she said. The expert also cited social-economic implications that ""long COVID"" would inflict upon society in the future. ""In the U.S. alone, over 174,000 COVID infants will have a life course impacted by this pandemic,"" she said. ""And it's not only going to be impacting individuals and families, but the economic impact of long COVID ... is that it's going to cost us 3.7 trillion (U.S.) dollars. That's going to have financial impacts."" VACCINE INEQUALITY While COVAX was launched in 2020 to accelerate the development and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines and to guarantee fair and equitable access for every country in the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) has long been complaining about rich countries stockpiling the majority of multiple vaccine supplies. Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, said at the WEF that for three years in half of the lower-income countries, 53 percent of the population have got their primary vaccination. Globally, the coverage rate is 64 percent. ""We realize that the disparities were still there,"" Berkley said. Addressing a panel discussion at the WEF, Michael Ryan, executive director of WHO's Health Emergencies Program, said that ""there is no way out of this pandemic right now without vaccines as the central strategic pillar."" ""Being able to use those vaccines equitably is not only a fair and important humanitarian objective, it's the best way for us all to get out of the pandemic phase that we're currently in right now,"" Ryan said. To ensure vaccine equity, Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a global vaccine partnership, called on countries and manufacturers at the WEF to prioritize vaccine supply to the global program COVAX and to support the local production of tests, vaccines and treatments around the world. Hatchett also asked pharmaceutical companies to stand in solidarity with developing countries by sharing licences, know-how and technology to find a way out of the pandemic. BUILDING TRUST Even with enough vaccines and preparedness, response to similar public health crises in the future could still be compromised, if there is a lack of solid trust between the public, governments and academia. Meanwhile, the rampant spread of misinformation on social media would also make things worse. Williams said a diverse society needs to have multiple layers of communicators and different styles of communicating. The expert said governments should understand the people and the communities they are serving, reckon with the reasons for mistrust, and then work collaboratively and respectfully in addressing the appropriate message and messenger to promote change. ""That's where a better understanding and behavioral sciences are going to help us,"" said Williams. Berkley pinpointed ""intentional misinformation"" as one of the challenges, while citing the bad COVID situation in the United States as an example. ""It's about the political climate and misinformation ... That's really unfortunate,"" Berkley said. ""And even other external experts, who might have been able to help, were then also demonized."" The WHO has labeled the pandemic-related misinformation as an ""infodemic,"" which refers to ""too much information including false or misleading information in digital and physical environments during a disease outbreak."" It has called for an infodemic management by listening to community concerns and questions, promoting understanding of risk and health expert advice, building resilience to misinformation, and engaging and empowering communities to take positive action.",Xinhua,2023-01-22 10:16
536,"Davos may be over, but the weeklong affair left behind some lasting changes","GENEVA, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting 2023 closed on Friday, with more than 2,000 honorable guests participating in hundreds of sessions during the weeklong event. This year's version remained unchanged in some respects. For instance, global elites gathered for brainstorming in the same ""Davos spirit,"" China was given plenty of attention and climate change was a hot topic. But there were some notable and lasting changes. GEOPOLITICAL EUROPE First, a more divided Europe emerged from a surge in geopolitical confrontations, reflected in the absence of a Russian delegation from Davos. Tensions between the West and Russia intensified during the Ukraine crisis. Europe has proceeded with ""de-Russification"" policies, particularly in its energy sector. Despite strategic partnerships between Russian companies and the forum, Russian political and business leaders were not invited to this year's event. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in his Davos speech that Germany had stopped importing Russian gas and coal, indicating ""a profound turning point in German foreign and security policy."" Similarly, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen revealed that Europe has collectively reduced its foreign dependence on pipeline gas by 80 percent in less than one year. Their statements imply that ""de-Russification"" is underway in Europe, yet its outcome remains unknown. CONSENSUS ON GLOBAL CHALLENGES Another change is the growing consensus that humanity's challenges have never been greater, evolving from regional and individual issues to global and interconnected ones. As the first in-person event held since the COVID-19 pandemic, organizers described this year's affair as occurring amid the most complex geopolitical and geo-economic situation in decades. WEF Founder and Executive Chairman Klaus Schwab has repeatedly stressed that today's world is facing multiple unprecedented crises, such as an energy transition, the pandemic, climate change and geopolitical tensions. In addition, a wobbling global economy, widening deficits in global governance, food and energy crises ... the list of unprecedented challenges tormenting humanity seems unending and is growing. ""Our world is plagued by a perfect storm on a number of fronts,"" said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in his Wednesday speech. ""We are in the worst situation I can remember in my lifetime,"" he warned. Not coincidentally, Gim Huay Neo, managing director of the WEF's Centre for Nature and Climate, deemed the multiple crises the ""new normal of the planet."" SHIFT TO RESILIENCE Third, the mood has shifted away from a focus on growth to a focus on resilience. A global economic recovery remains fragile and tortuous, with many countries grappling with supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures. Policymakers are being called upon to take robust measures to build up resilience. ""Black swan"" events over the past three years have made economic resilience a core agenda for every country and business, said Khaldoon Khalifa Al Mubarak, CEO of Mubadala Investment Company, calling for moving from a cost-driven to a resilience-driven mindset. Michelle Williams, dean of the faculty at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, said the ""long COVID"" impact on the economic and financial sectors is here to stay and that the entire health system and societies must rebuild resilience from such an impact. For her part, Egyptian Minister of International Cooperation Rania A. Al-Mashat said Egypt knows firsthand the impact of climate change and firmly believes that investing in climate protection is investing in economic resilience. Other topics at the forum included a growing call for re-globalization, artificial intelligence, the meta-universe and data regulations, and such emerging topics as future work styles and demographic trends. All shed light on the current evolution and development of humanity. But one thing remains unchanged: Only in unity can the global community make steady progress and achieve its long-term goals.",Xinhua,2023-01-22 15:32
537,Distribution system breakdown triggers power outage across Pakistan,"  ISLAMABAD, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- Millions of Pakistanis encountered power outage on Monday morning after the power distribution system of the South Asian country broke down, said the ministry of energy.

541,China-made trains enter service in Istanbul's new metro line,"  ISTANBUL, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- A new metro line connecting central Istanbul and the city's new international airport officially opened to the public on Sunday, featuring China-made automated driverless trains that could run up to 120 kilometers per hour. ""This 800,000 daily capacity metro line will allow travel from Kagithane Station to the Istanbul Airport in 24 minutes,"" said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during the opening ceremony. The fully-automated, driverless trains were built by Chinese company CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd. (CRRC ZELC), which signed a purchase and commissioning contract with Trkiye's Directorate-General of Infrastructure Investments back in January 2020. The 34-kilometer metro line between the Kagithane Station in central Istanbul and the city's new international airport boasts Trkiye's fastest trains, and the vehicles running the line are China's first 120km/h automated driverless metro project for the overseas market, according to CRRC ZELC. The contract was for 176 subway cars and required a 60 percent localization rate in Trkiye. Haluk Oguz, a management specialist at CRRC ZELC's subsidiary in Trkiye, told Xinhua that they have delivered 40 vehicles. ""Work on the other 136 is ongoing,"" he said, adding ""they will be manufactured at our factory in Ankara."" Faruk Bostanci, administrative affairs chief at CRRC Trkiye, said that ""new additions (to the line), which will be made as manufacturing continues, will increase the train frequency and provide a faster, more convenient transportation network for Istanbul residents."" After trying out the train, Istanbul resident Emirhan Ersoy praised the new vehicles. ""Both the heating system and the visual screens are very nice, and the sound system works very well,"" he said, adding that the high capacity of the cabins was another point of distinction. The vehicles operate in a 4-car formation with a maximum capacity of 1,100 passengers. The exterior of the trains is decorated with Turkish cultural elements such as tulip motifs. Yalcin Eyigun, general manager of the Directorate-General of Infrastructure Investments at Turkish Transportation and Infrastructure Ministry, praised the Chinese partner for overcoming all kinds of difficulties during the project despite the COVID-19 pandemic-related setbacks. Over the past decade, CRRC ZELC has supplied more than 400 metro vehicles to Trkiye, which are now operating in its three largest cities, namely Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir. Zhou Qinghe, chairman of the board of the CRRC ZELC, said that his company is willing to strengthen cooperation with Trkiye and write new chapters of ""shared growth through discussion and collaboration.""

539,Avian flu could decimate Australian black swans: study,"SYDNEY, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- A new research led by the University of Queensland (UQ) has revealed that the unique genetics of Australian black swan leaves the species vulnerable to viral illnesses such as avian flu. The research, published in Genome Biology on Monday, generated a first-ever genome of the black swan, which revealed the species lacks some immune genes which help other wild waterfowl combat infectious diseases, implicating the importance of biosecurity and conservation awareness. Co-author of the paper Kirsty Short from UQ's School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences said the geographic isolation of Australia's black swans means limited exposure to pathogens commonly found in other parts of the world, leading to reduced immune diversity. ""Unlike Mallard ducks for example, black swans are extremely sensitive to highly pathogenic avian influenza -- HPAI which is often referred to as bird flu -- and can die from it within three days,"" Short said. ""Our data suggests that the immune system of the black swan is such that, should any avian viral infection become established in its native habitat, their survival would be in peril."" Short noted though HPAI is not currently in Australia, it has spread from Asia to North America, Europe, North Africa and South America, and the risk to the species is ""very real."" ""When it was introduced to new locations, such as Chile and Peru, thousands of wild seabirds perished,"" she said. Over the years there have been small homegrown instances of HPAI viruses in Australia. The recent largest outbreak of HPAI viruses (H7 subtypes) was in Victoria in 2020, which involved considerable cost and losses to the Victorian poultry industry, according to the Australian Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Short said the finding that black swans were missing key genes could also suggest they were probably susceptible to a lot of other different viruses, apart from avian flu. With the findings from the study, researchers and conservationists hope it could help increase awareness about how vulnerable Australia's bird species are to avian influenza and the highly precarious situation they are in.",Xinhua,2023-01-24 10:14
542,Suspect of California mass shooting on Lunar New Year's Eve found dead,"  LOS ANGELES, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- The suspect of the California mass shooting on Saturday night was found dead in another city of what authorities believe was a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Five women and five men were killed while another 10 people were injured in a mass shooting in the city of Monterey Park, 16 km east of Los Angeles downtown, the authorities said Sunday. The fatal incident occurred at 10:22 p.m. (06:22 GMT) Saturday local time in Star Ballroom Dance Studio, a popular ballroom dance facility operated for about 30 years, when it was hosting an event to celebrate the countdown to the Chinese Lunar New Year. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said Sunday evening that the suspect was identified as Huu Can Tran, who entered the party and opened fire before fleeing the scene in a white van. The vehicle was pulled over in a parking lot Sunday morning and surrounded by policemen from Torrance, located roughly 50 km southwest of Monterey Park after they heard a gunshot from inside the vehicle. The man inside the van, who was found dead following a three-hour standoff with the Special Weapons and Tactics team, was confirmed as the suspect later, according to Luna. No motive was disclosed at a Sunday evening news conference. Monterey Park, a city of 61,000 residents located on the eastern edge of Los Angeles, has a majority Asian American population. Starting Saturday, the city hosted an annual two-day Chinese Lunar New Year celebration, one of the largest events in the region.

755,Global economy projected to grow 1.9 pct in 2023: UN report,"     UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- World output growth is projected to decelerate from an estimated 3.0 percent in 2022 to 1.9 percent in 2023, marking one of the lowest growth rates in recent decades, according to a UN report launched on Wednesday. The UN World Economic Situation and Prospects 2023 report predicted global growth to moderately pick up to 2.7 percent in 2024, as some macroeconomic headwinds are expected to begin to subside next year. Amid high inflation, aggressive monetary tightening and heightened uncertainties, the current downturn has slowed the pace of economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, threatening several countries -- both developed and developing -- with the prospects of recession in 2023, the report said. It said growth momentum significantly weakened in the United States, the European Union and other developed economies in 2022, adversely impacting the rest of the global economy through a number of channels. In the United States, gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to expand by only 0.4 percent in 2023 after an estimated growth of 1.8 percent in 2022, the report said.   Growth in China is projected to moderately improve in 2023. With the government adjusting its COVID policy in late 2022 and easing monetary and fiscal policies, China's economic growth is forecast to accelerate to 4.8 percent in 2023, according to the report. It pointed out that tightening global financial conditions, coupled with a strong dollar, exacerbated fiscal and debt vulnerabilities in developing countries. Most developing countries saw a slower job recovery in 2022 and continue to face considerable employment slack, the report said. It warned that slower growth, coupled with elevated inflation and mounting debt vulnerabilities, threatens to further set back hard-won achievements in sustainable development, deepening the already negative effects of the current crises. In 2022, the number of people facing acute food insecurity more than doubled compared to 2019, reaching almost 350 million. A prolonged period of economic weakness and slow income growth would not only hamper poverty eradication, but also constrain countries' ability to invest in the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) more broadly, the report stressed. ""The current crises are hitting the most vulnerable the hardest -- often through no fault of their own. The global community needs to step up joint efforts to avert human suffering and support an inclusive and sustainable future for all,"" Li Junhua, UN undersecretary-general for economic and social affairs, said in a statement on the release of the report.   The report called for governments to avoid fiscal austerity which would stifle growth and disproportionately affect the most vulnerable groups, affect progress in gender equality and stymie development prospects across generations. It recommended reallocation and reprioritization of public expenditures through direct policy interventions that will create jobs and reinvigorate growth, noting this will require strengthening of social protection systems, ensuring continued support through targeted and temporary subsidies, cash transfers, and discounts on utility bills, which can be complemented with reductions in consumption taxes or custom duties. ""The pandemic, the global food and energy crises, climate risks and the looming debt crisis in many developing countries are testing the limits of existing multilateral frameworks,"" the report said. ""International cooperation has never been more important than now to face multiple global crises and bring the world back on track to achieve the SDGs."" Additional SDG financing needs in developing countries vary by source, but are estimated to amount to a few trillion U.S. dollars per year, according to the report. Stronger international commitment, the report said, is urgently needed to expand access to emergency financial assistance, to restructure and reduce debt burdens across developing countries, and scale up SDG financing.",Xinhua,2023-01-26 09:31
752,Chinese New Year celebrated across U.S.,"Chinese communities across the United States are holding traditional cultural activities to celebrate the arrival of the Chinese New Year of the Rabbit, which began on Jan. 22, 2023.

508,Global economy likely to beat forecasts as China rebounds: Nordea Bank,"HELSINKI, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- The global economy may outperform expectations this year despite its current slow growth, the European financial services group Nordea Bank said in a press release on Wednesday. High inflation is eroding households' purchasing power, and in the Nordic countries the housing markets face a sharp slowdown. However, according to the Helsinki-based bank, the recent economic developments have been surprisingly positive and ""there are signs that the year 2023 could also cause positive surprises."" The mild winter has cushioned the harmful effects of the energy crisis in the eurozone, and China's rapid reopening after the COVID-19 lockdowns is returning the country to as a strong driver of the global economy, Tuuli Koivu, chief economist at Nordea Bank, said. But risks remain. The tight labor market and rising inflation in the United States and the eurozone may result in a return to tighter monetary policy and an economic slowdown. For Finland, Nordea Bank, the largest financial services group in the Nordic region and one of the biggest banks in Europe, projects zero gross domestic product (GDP) growth this year and 1 percent growth in 2024. The growth of Finland's economy slowed down at the end of 2022, when the strong rise in energy prices and interest rates reduced private consumption and export demand. As a result, the economic outlook for this year is very mixed with bleak consumer and corporate confidence. However, inflation in the country is expected to ease along with an anticipated wage growth, which would relieve household finances towards the end of the year, the bank said.

509,U.S. sanctions hinder Iran from fulfilling humanitarian responsibilities: official,"TEHRAN, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- The head of the Iranian Red Crescent Society (IRCS) said the U.S. sanctions have hindered the IRCS from fulfilling its domestic and international responsibilities and commitments, the IRIB news agency reported Wednesday. Pirhossein Kolivand made the remarks during a meeting of the heads of the national red cross and red crescent societies in the Middle East and North Africa being held in Beirut, capital of Lebanon. The negative impacts of the U.S. sanctions Kolivand listed include foreign banks' refrainment from cooperation in transfer of money to and from Iran and Iran's difficulties in importing medicine and medical equipment and rescue items. The sanctions have also hindered Iran's ability to update its rescue and relief fleet and equipment, he added. Iran has been under the U.S. sanctions for the past four decades. The sanctions intensified following the U.S. withdrawal from a 2015 nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, signed between Iran and world powers in July 2015. Although the United States claims that humanitarian items, including medicine and foodstuff, are not included in the sanctions list, its embargoes on Iran's oil exports and banking sector have in practice prevented the country from importing such goods.",Xinhua,2023-01-26 10:17
510,Biden announces equipping Ukraine with U.S.-made tanks,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Joe Biden announced Wednesday that his administration will provide Ukraine with 31 U.S.-made M1 Abrams tanks, which Russia has said will be its target if they were to be used in the ongoing conflict between Moscow and Kiev. ""Today I'm announcing that the United States will be sending 31 Abrams tanks to Ukraine, the equivalent of one Ukrainian battalion,"" Biden said, addressing the nation in televised remarks from the White House. Biden said the decision was recommended by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who, together with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, flanked Biden as he spoke. ""Because it'll enhance Ukraine's capacity to defend its territory and achieve the strategic objectives,"" Biden said. Biden said the United States is also sending Ukraine parts and equipment necessary to sustain the sophisticated tanks, adding that Washington will soon begin to train Ukrainian soldiers on how to operate and maintain the tanks, the delivery of which, he noted, will take time. The U.S. delivery of M1 Abrams tanks, among the most powerful and capable of the kind in the world, is considered yet another major development in the Ukraine crisis, potentially further escalating the situation as other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) also intended to aid Ukraine with tanks. Before the formal announcement by Biden, reports of U.S. provision of the M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine had already infuriated Russia. Moscow's ambassador in Washington, Anatoly Antonov, said Tuesday that ""if a decision to transfer to Kiev M1 Abrams is made, American tanks without any doubt will be destroyed as all other samples of NATO military equipment."" ""If the United States decides to supply tanks, it will be impossible to justify such step using arguments about 'defensive weapons,'"" the envoy said. ""This would be another blatant provocation against the Russian Federation."" The U.S. commitment came on the heel of the confirmation from Germany that it will deliver 14 Leopard 2 A6 tanks to Ukraine, ending a stalemate where a previously reluctant Germany found itself under increasing pressure from the United States and other allies to authorize tank shipment to Ukraine, which has long demanded such weapons. Other NATO countries, including Poland, the Netherlands, Norway and Spain, have either committed to or been considering sending Ukraine the Leopard 2 tanks. Britain has already said it will send its Challenger 2 tanks to aid Ukraine's offensive in the conflict with Russia. Biden said in his remarks that earlier in the day, he spoke with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni ""as part of our close coordination on support for Ukraine.""",Xinhua,2023-01-26 10:18
511,Germany approves sending Leopard tanks to Ukraine,"BERLIN, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- The German government has decided to provide Ukraine with 14 Leopard 2A6 battle tanks from its own Bundeswehr stocks. The aim is to ""quickly assemble"" two tank battalions with additional units coming from European partners, the government said on Wednesday. ""This decision follows our well-known line of supporting Ukraine to the best of our ability,"" Chancellor Olaf Scholz said at a government meeting in Berlin. ""We are acting in a closely coordinated manner internationally."" Other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have recently put pressure on Germany to supply battle tanks to Ukraine. On Tuesday, Poland was the first country to officially request Berlin's approval to send tanks from its own stock. As Germany will now supply Leopard tanks to Ukraine, NATO partners were also given the go-ahead to do so. Ukrainian crews are also to be provided with training on the Leopard tanks as well as logistics, ammunition and maintenance for the systems, the government said. Shipments of Leopard tanks to Ukraine would ""not bode well"" for Russian-German relations and will ""undoubtedly leave an unavoidable mark for the future of these relations,"" Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agency TASS on Tuesday. Last Friday, Germany's Minister of Defense Boris Pistorius postponed the decision and instead announced further deliveries of Marder infantry fighting vehicles, Gepard anti-aircraft tanks and a Patriot surface-to-air missile system to Ukraine. Germany's military support for Ukraine totals 3.3 billion euros (3.6 billion U.S. dollars), the country's Defense Ministry said last week. (1 euro = 1.09 U.S. dollar)",Xinhua,2023-01-26 10:55

""China's optimization of its COVID-19 strategy could drive our tourism growth, our export growth to China, and inflows of Chinese investments into Cambodia,"" she said at the forum. Narin said Cambodia's economy is forecast to grow by 5.6 percent in 2023, up from 5.2 percent in 2022, supported by the garment and non-garment manufacturing sectors, agriculture, and tourism. ""This year, our manufacturing sector is projected to grow by 5.5 percent, agriculture is forecast to increase by 1.1 percent, and tourism is expected to see a big jump,"" she said.

515,First phase of China-built light rail project inaugurated in Nigeria,"  LAGOS, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- The first phase of a China-built electric-powered light rail project in Nigeria's southwestern state of Lagos was officially open for service on Tuesday. Undertaken by China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) since 2010, the completed tracks of the Lagos Rail Mass Transit (LRMT) Blue Line project span 13 km in the first phase and cover five stations. The LRMT Blue Line project is the first rail infrastructure traversing Okokomaiko, a densely populated area in the western part of Lagos, and Marina, a business district on Lagos Island. Speaking at a banquet held by the Lagos state government before the inauguration ceremony, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari described the project as ""historic,"" noting that the rail will reduce traffic congestion and air pollution, as well as improve the lives of locals. The president also attended the contract signing ceremony for the construction of the second phase of the LRMT Blue Line project by the Lagos metropolitan area transport authority and the CCECC. Cui Jianchun, the Chinese ambassador to Nigeria, said the completion of the first phase of the project demonstrated the harmony of China-Nigeria relations. ""It is a line of speed, line of sustainability, line of harmony,"" Cui said. The new light rail would reduce travel time, improve the quality of life of citizens and make Lagos one of the most resilient megacities in Africa that would compete favorably with other cities around the world, said Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos. The iconic Marina Station has the capacity to process about 25,000 passengers per hour, Sanwo-Olu added.

517,"German, U.S. promises of tanks spark concerns of escalating Russia-Ukraine conflict","   BEIJING, Jan. 27 (Xinhua) -- Germany and the United States separately announced on Wednesday that they will send advanced battle tanks to Ukraine, ending a stalemate where a previously reluctant Germany found itself under increasing pressure from its allies to authorize tank shipments to Ukraine. While Kiev welcomed the tanks, expecting them to be a game-changer in the battlefield against Russia, analysts expressed concerns that such heavy weapons may intensify the situation, warning of the possibility of a direct war between Russia and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).    On Wednesday, the German government not only agreed to provide Ukraine with 14 Leopard 2 battle tanks from its own stocks but also approved of its customer countries doing the same. ""We are acting in a closely coordinated manner internationally,"" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said at a government meeting in Berlin. Hours later, U.S. President Joe Biden announced that his administration will provide Ukraine with 31 U.S.-made M1 Abrams tanks. A day later, the Canadian Defense Ministry announced it would send four Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine and is considering sending more at a later date. Ahead of the latest promised supplies, some other NATO countries had announced increasing weapon supplies to Ukraine, especially heavier weapons. Britain said on Jan. 14 it would send 14 Challenger 2 main battle tanks to aid Ukraine's offensive against Russia, while other NATO countries, including Poland, the Netherlands, Norway and Spain, have either committed to or been considering sending Ukraine Leopard 2 tanks, though Berlin's approval -- a re-export requirement -- had not been given at that time. According to military arms experts, the German-made Leopard 2 is one of the most reputable battle tanks in the world, perhaps second only to the U.S.-made M1 Abrams tank. The deliveries of Leopard 2 tanks will take Ukrainian ground forces to a qualitatively new level, Ukrainian military expert Oleh Zhdanov told The Associated Press. However, Huang Rihan, professor at the School of International Relations of China's Huaqiao University, told Xinhua that tanks from so many different countries need time to adapt to the front-line situation in Ukraine, which will limit their performance. ""Therefore, it is a bit of an exaggeration to say now that these tanks will drastically change the battlefield situation,"" he said.    Germany's move was announced following weeks of mounting pressure from its allies, including the United States and other NATO members, who urged Berlin to step up its military support to Ukraine. Unlike countries such as the United States, Germany has been more cautious in providing heavier weapons to Ukraine, trying to avoid an escalation of the deterioration of German-Russian relations. Ahead of Germany's decision, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov had told Russian news agency TASS that shipments of Leopard tanks to Ukraine would ""not bode well"" for Russian-German relations and would ""undoubtedly leave an unavoidable mark for the future of these relations."" Earlier this month at Davos, when asked about supplying tanks to Ukraine, Scholz said ""we are never doing something just by ourselves, but together with others, especially the United States."" At that time, some analysts said Germany was trying to dodge the front-runner-role in fueling the present war. However, Washington responded that it was Germany's own decision whether to supply Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine.    The decision that the United States and Germany will allow the export of M1 Abrams and Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, alongside the British Challenger 2 tanks promised in mid-January, sparked concerns over a possible escalation of tensions. Fyodor Lukyanov, research director of the Russian think tank Valdai International Discussion Club, said that delivering tanks in all likelihood will lead Russia and NATO to teeter on the brink of a direct conflict. Russia on Thursday slammed Western promises to supply Ukraine with heavy tanks, saying it saw the development as evidence of direct and growing U.S. and European involvement in the conflict. ""It (providing tanks) reveals ... Washington does not want the war to end,"" Huang said, ""such a protracted war would be in America's best interest."" Washington is ""happy to delegate the right to participate in the escalation to its European allies, in particular Germany,"" Lukyanov was quoted by TASS news agency as saying. ""Germany risks being drawn directly into the war as a result,"" Tino Chrupalla, co-leader of the far-right party Alternative for Germany, has said on social media.   The Left Party, another opposition party in Germany, also warned of a possible escalation of the conflict. ""The supply of Leopard battle tanks, which ends a further taboo, potentially takes us closer to a third world war than in the direction of peace in Europe,"" the party's parliamentary leader, Dietmar Bartsch, was quoted by German news agency DPA as saying. The attitude of the United States and NATO is an important factor in determining whether peace can be achieved, Huang said. ""Today's Russia-Ukraine situation is largely caused by NATO's eastward expansion,"" he said, calling on the United States and other NATO countries to play a constructive role. ""The prolonged conflict between Russia and Ukraine is disastrous for Europe and the world economy. If we want the world to resume sound development, we must return to the road of peace talks,"" Huang said.",Xinhua,2023-01-28 08:24

""We had a prolonged and consistent dialogue. We discussed in detail our bilateral relation,"" said Lavrov, who was in Luanda as part of his visit to Africa, which had previously taken him to South Africa and Eswatini.

""We believe that developing countries deserve to have access to long-term financing to underpin their structural transformation, the investment in climate resilience and low carbon development,"" Georgieva told a round table discussion with East African region central bank governors and ministers of finance in Rwanda's capital city Kigali. The discussion focused on climate financing schemes for developing countries and the operational context of the IMF's resilience and sustainability facility. Participants also discussed innovative homegrown solutions to mitigate climate change and how the international community can support or act as a catalyst to mobilize public and private financing. ""The IMF is committed to supporting countries' climate policies, especially through the new Resilience and Sustainability Facility which countries can use as a catalyst for investment to build resilience,"" Georgieva said. She noted that the IMF attaches great significance to climate action in the context of preserving macroeconomic stability and promoting growth and employment. She also stressed the need for Africa to be at the center of climate finance negotiations. Africa has contributed very little to the problem, but it is already suffering the consequences of climate change in a very dramatic way, she said. ""In Africa, drought and floods are causing loss of productivity, agriculture produce, harming people and communities,"" she added. Developed countries had pledged nearly 100 billion U.S. dollars per year by 2020 for climate action in developing countries, which is yet to be fulfilled. Last December, the IMF announced a 319 million U.S. dollars loan for Rwanda under the resilience and sustainability facility, to support the country's ambitious agenda to build resilience to climate change and help to catalyze further financing, the first for an African country. The initiative aims at helping low-income and vulnerable middle-income member countries to address longer-term structural challenges such as climate change with longer-term low-cost financing.

""It is a pity that the book said the Turkish army does not have the capacity to defeat Daesh (the Islamic State),"" Cavusoglu told a press conference that was also attended by visiting Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai. ""The only army fighting close combat against Daesh was the Turkish army. While we were clearing the north of Syria from Daesh, the U.S. sent the YPG and Daesh members to Afghanistan by planes and buses during Pompeo's tenure. They are responsible for the attacks in Afghanistan,"" Cavusoglu said. The Turkish minister said he believed Pompeo's purpose to write the book was to propel him to the U.S. presidency. Ankara considers the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) as the Syrian branch of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is listed as a terrorist organization by Türkiye, the United States and the European Union and has rebelled against the Turkish government for over three decades. Pompeo, who served as U.S. secretary of state between 2018 and 2021, said in his book ""Never Give an Inch: Fighting for the America I Love"" that he was worried that Ankara's plan to fight against the IS could lead to ethnic cleansing of the Kurds in Syria. Ties between the two NATO member states have long been strained due to U.S. military support to the YPG, which cooperated with Washington in carrying out operations against the IS.

The attacks also hit energy infrastructure in the southern Odesa region, causing blackouts, the head of the Odesa military administration Maksym Marchenko said on Telegram. Western arms supplies to Ukraine testify to their direct involvement in the conflict, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday after Germany approved sending Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. ""There are constant statements from European capitals and Washington that the supplies of various weapon systems, including tanks, to Ukraine in no way mean the involvement of these countries or the alliance (NATO) in the hostilities that are taking place in Ukraine,"" Peskov told a daily briefing. ""We categorically disagree with this ... Everything that the alliance ... does is perceived as direct involvement in the conflict. And we see that this involvement is growing,"" he said.

756,U.S. foreign arms sales increase significantly in fiscal 2022 mainly due to military support for Ukraine,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. foreign arms sales grew significantly in fiscal year 2022, according to data released by the Department of State, which attributed the increase mainly to U.S. military support for Ukraine during the latter's conflict with Russia. The total value of State Department-authorized government-to-government foreign military sales was 51.9 billion U.S. dollars in fiscal 2022, the 12-month period ending Sept. 30, 2022, up 49.1 percent from the previous fiscal year's 34.8 billion dollars, the data showed. The so-called direct commercial sales, or sales of weapons and military equipment to foreign governments by U.S. defense contractors, also ticked up in fiscal 2022, increasing 48.6 percent to 153.7 billion dollars, compared to 103.4 billion dollars in fiscal 2021. At the end of fiscal 2022, 14,445 entities were registered with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls to conduct defense trade activities, which is a slight increase from fiscal 2021, the department said in a press release dated Wednesday. The State Department attributed the spike to continuous U.S. provision of military assistance to Ukraine amid the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, while claiming that ""arms transfers and defense trade are important tools of U.S. foreign policy."" According to the Defense Department's latest update released Wednesday, the United States has more than 27.1 billion dollars in security assistance for Ukraine since the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out on Feb. 24, 2022. The 2022 arms sales numbers are potential deals the State Department has notified Congress, not the final sales, meaning some of the transactions may be refused by Congress, thus forcing the administration to engage in further negotiations. As far as the destinations of those sales are concerned, they cover U.S. allies and partners in Europe, as demands for U.S. weapons soared especially in NATO countries, and in the Asia Pacific and the Middle East regions.",Xinhua,2023-01-28 13:56

486,U.S. invasion of Panama left enduring scars on victims' families,"PANAMA CITY, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) -- It's poignant for Trinidad Ayola to recall the day when she claimed from the hospital the body of her husband, whose life was taken during the 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama. Trauma still lingers for Panamanians like Ayola whose families died during the invasion, though the National Mourning Day, which was established last March and falls on Dec. 20 each year, offered a welcome occasion to mourn the loss of hundreds of lives. ""It seems the stars have aligned,"" said Ayola, who took part in a years-long campaign to make the national tragedy officially recognized. Ayola's husband was a lieutenant in the Panamanian Air Force. ""I could prepare a proper funeral for him, but there were at least 30 families that continued to search for the remains of loved ones who disappeared in the military operation,"" said Ayola. Casualty numbers vary. The UN estimated around 500 civilian deaths in the month-long battle ending late January 1990, whereas some other organizations said the figure could be 1,000 to 3,000 in total. ""It was not necessary to kill so many people and launch an invasion to defend what they called democracy,"" said Ayola. Ayola suffered from anxiety and insomnia for the following seven years, and her young daughter experienced emotional stress and trauma. Panamanians agree that force was disproportionately used to humiliate the small country. The U.S. invasion destroyed homes and businesses, and plunged many into poverty in its wake. The invasion, dubbed ""Operation Just Cause"" by the United States, was only aimed at protecting American interests, said Ayola. That still rings true today, she continued, with Washington ""blockading other nations to subdue them, inflicting hunger, lack of health care and misery on them.""",Xinhua,2023-01-28 14:45

The hour-long video captured several police officers beating Tyre Nichols, 29, during a traffic stop on Jan. 7 in Memphis, Tennessee, where they allegedly stopped him for reckless driving. The officers pepper-sprayed and shocked Nichols with Taser while they can also be seen beating the motorist with a baton and kicking and punching him. Nichols, subdued, kept yelling ""mom.""

Demonstrations have broken out in a series of cities, including Memphis, Washington, D.C., New York, Atlanta, and Los Angeles, over the police treatment of Nichols this weekend.

507,WTO members confront U.S. abuse of security exception for protectionist purpose,"  GENEVA, Jan. 29 (Xinhua) -- Members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) have denounced the United States for its abusive series of appeals against the global trade watchdog's panel rulings over its import tariffs and flawed labeling of goods origins, urging the country to fulfill its obligations as a WTO member and stop its unilateral and protectionist moves. At the latest Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) meeting held here on Friday, five WTO members -- China, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey, and Hong Kong -- required the plenary meeting to pass five panel rulings regarding duties imposed by the United States on steel and aluminium imports and U.S. origin marking requirement applicable to goods produced in Hong Kong. Before the meeting, the United States had appealed four panel rulings regarding duties imposed by Washington on imports of steel and aluminum products from China, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey. The United States had also filed a seperate appeal against another ruling issued last month, in which Washington deliberately mislabeled products made in Hong Kong as ""Chinese-made."" The shift in the origin of those goods to be imported to the United States was ruled ""not justified"" by a DSB panel. The world's largest economy also declared it would postpone implementing a panel report regarding a dispute initiated by the European Union (EU) targeting U.S. anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of ripe olives from Spain.  Washington has a long history of trade bullying. Though it used its right of appeal as a WTO member, its action amount ""to effectively blocking"" WTO rulings, according to a statement by the EU on Friday. The EU noted that the panel reports have been appealed, but these appeals cannot be currently heard by the Appellate Body, given that it cannot function. Previously, it normally takes three months for the WTO Appellate Body to rule on any appeals it receives. However, the appeal court has halted operation because the United States has blocked the appointment of new judges and required an overall reform. Therefore, appeals cannot be processed, and related rulings cannot move forward. Canada noted that since Dec. 11, 2019, the Appellate Body has effectively been non-functioning, according to a statement delivered at Friday's meeting. The United States tends to appeal every unfavorable panel report and refuse to comply with the results of any proceedings of the DSB, China's Ambassador to the WTO Li Chenggang told a DSB meeting. ""These troubling behaviors of the U.S. have clearly depicted an image of the U.S. as a unilateral bully, a rule breaker and a supply chain disruptor,"" Li said. So far, 127 WTO members have attempted on 61 occasions to start the selection process for filling vacancies on the Appellate Body. Still, the United States blocked the proposed decision. Canada stressed in its statement that all parties to the dispute must fulfill their good faith commitment under the Dispute Settlement Understanding by making every effort to find an acceptable solution. In the long run, no member would benefit from a situation where disputes remain unresolved. It said that a member acting in good faith should find no comfort in an unfair -- and short-term -- advantage that has arisen because of the absence of a functioning Appellate Body. The EU also encourages all parties to find a solution that preserves the rights of both the complainant and respondent.    In March 2018, the United States began imposing Section 232 duties on steel and aluminum products to protect its domestic industry under the guise of national security. Given that Washington has exempted 70 percent of its steel imports from the additional duties, the restricted imports only accounted for 5 percent of U.S. steel consumption, in which defense use took only roughly 0.15 percent, Li said at the meeting. ""In other words, Section 232 measures are overwhelmingly protectionist, as its contribution to national security is negligible at best,"" Li noted. From the outset, the United States deployed these additional duties as an instrument of economic coercion, using them to force other members to enter into quota arrangements or make concessions to the United States in trade negotiations, said the Chinese ambassador. These measures have been widely opposed, sued by several WTO members and found WTO-inconsistent by all panels. The findings of the panel in this dispute demonstrated once again that a security exception is not a ""safe harbor"" for unilateralism or protectionism, Li added. Alparslan Acarsoy, Turkish ambassador to the WTO, said at the 15th Trade Policy Review of the United States held on Dec. 2022 that the United States imposed additional tariffs on imported aluminum and steel products, which clearly violates WTO rules. He urged the United States to cancel the additional tax measures to avoid further damage to the multilateral trading system. Türkiye believes that the United States has systematically and structurally damaged members' confidence in the multilateral trading system, he added. ""Before the panel, the U.S. relied upon Section 232 reports that formed the basis of the measures to argue that the worldwide excess capacity of steel could damage its domestic steel sector such that it would not be able to increase or maintain production of steel required to address national emergencies,"" said Jayant Raghu Ram, a writer with Indian law firm Lakshmikumaran &Sridharan Attorneys, in a recent article. ""This excess capacity, according to the U.S., constituted an 'emergency in international relations.'"" ""However, the panel wasted no words in dismantling the U.S. tenuous defense and held that the situation of excess global steel capacity"" did not ""constitute an 'emergency in international relations,'"" Ram said. On Aug. 11, 2020, the United States required Hong Kong products exported to the United States to be labeled ""Made in China,"" which the WTO ruled in late December 2022 violated the country's obligations under the trade organization's rules. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government welcomed the ruling. The ruling has once again confirmed that the United States has disregarded international trade rules, attempted to impose discriminatory and unfair requirements unilaterally, unreasonably suppressed Hong Kong products and enterprises, and politicized economic and trade issues, said Algernon Yau, secretary for commerce and economic development of the HKSAR government, in a statement. ""When President Biden of the less conservative Democratic Party was voted into power in 2020, it was expected that the U.S. government would tone down its nihilistic rhetoric towards the multilateral trading system and withdraw measures that seemingly violate WTO law, most notably the Section 232 measures,"" Ram added. ""However, irrespective of such change in guard, the United States continues to maintain status quo in respect of such measures,"" he said. ""Though the U.S. detraction from the rule of law in the WTO's rules-based system is not unknown or surprising, WTO members may find relief in the fact that the panel has outrightly held these infamous measures as inconsistent with WTO law,"" Ram noted.",Xinhua,2023-01-30 08:20

This was criminal,"" said David Rausch, director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, who told reporters on Friday that he saw the video before it was released to the public and found it ""absolutely appalling."" ""What's most shocking about it all is the brutality and then at the end, the complete dehumanization of this man. He's not even human to them -- he's not even a person,"" Randolph McLaughlin, professor at the Elisabeth Haub School of Law and co-chair of the Newman Ferrara civil rights practice, told The Guardian. The five officers involved in the ferocity were fired after an internal investigation and are facing criminal charges, including second-degree murder. The incident came nearly three years after the police murder of 46-year-old African American man George Floyd, who died on May 25, 2020 after an encounter with Minneapolis police, during which officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes during a street arrest. Floyd's death sparked outrage and protests across the United States in the summer of 2020 against police brutality and systemic racism. However, such kind of tragedy continues to unfold in this country, and Nichols' ordeal once again reignited public anger this winter. Demonstrations have broken out in a series of cities, including Memphis, Washington D.C., New York, Atlanta, and Los Angeles during weekend, demanding justice for Nichols while decrying police violence and racism. ""Shame on this system,"" protesters chanted in downtown Washington D.C., on Friday night. Analysts said the fact that the five officers are Black in Nichols' case pointed out a systemic problem how people of color are treated regardless of officers' race in the country. It is the system and the tactics that foster racism and violence, rather than the specific racial identities of officers, said an a New York Times article on Saturday. Amber Sherman, an activist and organizer working with the Nichols family as they push for policy changes in the police, said that racism is a clear factor in policing when you look at whom the victims of police violence are, not the race of the officers. Officers of all races ""are indoctrinated into a practice that sees Black people and Brown people as less than,"" Sherman was quoted by the article as saying. It is not racism but culturism driving this, it is a culture in law enforcement where it is OK to be aggressive to those they are supposed to serve, said Robert Sausedo, the head of Community Build Inc, a Los Angeles-based non-profit organization. U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement that he was ""outraged and deeply pained to see the horrific video of the beating that resulted in Tyre Nichols' death."" ""It is yet another painful reminder of the profound fear and trauma, the pain, and the exhaustion that Black and Brown Americans experience every single day,"" Biden stressed. In a joint tweet released on Sunday, Barack and Michelle Obama said that Nichols' death is a ""painful reminder"" for America. ""The vicious, unjustified beating of Tyre Nichols and his ultimate death at the hands of five Memphis police officers is just the latest, painful reminder of how far America still has to go in fixing how we police our streets,"" the couple said. Police killed 1,186 people in the United States last year, according to Mapping Police Violence. In 2022, 26 percent of those killed by police were African Americans, who account for only 13 percent of the population.",Xinhua,2023-01-30 16:26
761,COVID-19 still int'l health emergency: WHO,"  GENEVA, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday that the COVID-19 pandemic still constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the WHO's highest alert level. The announcement came amid the recent increase of weekly reported deaths worldwide. After its quarterly assessment meeting on the COVID-19 pandemic on Friday, the WHO's International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee announced on Monday that COVID-19 continues to constitute a PHEIC, which has been concurred by WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. COVID-19 remains a dangerous infectious disease with the capacity to cause substantial damage to health systems, the committee said in a statement, while acknowledging that the COVID-19 pandemic may be approaching an inflection point. Although infection or vaccination may lead to higher levels of population immunity globally and limit the impact of morbidity and mortality, ""there is little doubt that this virus will remain a permanently established pathogen in humans and animals for the foreseeable future,"" the committee said. It then called for long-term public health action that will prioritize the mitigation of COVID-19 impact on morbidity and mortality. Meanwhile, the committee recommends that countries should achieve 100 percent vaccination coverage of high-priority groups, improve reporting of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance data to the WHO, and ensure long-term availability of medical countermeasures, such as COVID-19 vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics.",Xinhua,2023-01-31 08:14
470,"Biden says ""no"" to sending fighter jets to Ukraine","   WASHINGTON, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Joe Biden said on Monday that he won't approve sending F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine. ""No,"" Biden said in response to a question about the possibility of such a decision. As he spoke, Biden arrived back at the White House from a trip to Baltimore, Maryland. Biden also said he was planning to visit Poland but didn't yet know when. The president's remarks came as debate picked up steam over whether to arm Ukraine, which has been in conflict with Russia for nearly a year, with Western-made fighter jets. Asked about the administration's decision on potential delivery of F-16s to Ukraine, U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor Jonathan Finer said during an appearance on MSNBC last Thursday that ""we have not ruled in or out any specific systems."" ""We have tried to tailor our assistance to the phase of the fight that the Ukrainians are in. I don't have an announcement to make one way or the other,"" he added. Albeit a constant request from the authorities in Kiev, fighter jets have long been regarded by the West as a taboo in terms of military assistance for Ukraine, for fear that such deliveries would lead to an uncontrollable escalation of the conflict. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter last Wednesday that securing the provision of Western-type fighter jets are among the ""new tasks ahead"" for Ukraine. On the same day, the United States and Germany announced their respective decisions to send combat tanks to Ukraine. Ukraine's plea for fighter jets met with refusal from Germany, whose chancellor, Olaf Scholz, recently said combat aircraft is not an item on Berlin's list of weapons for Ukraine. ""The question of combat aircraft does not arise at all,"" Scholz said in an interview with Tagesspiegel published on Sunday. ""I can only advise against entering into a constant competition to outbid each other when it comes to weapons systems.""",Xinhua,2023-01-31 08:18
469,Inter-agency mission to Afghanistan reports positive signs concerning women's rights,"  UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- A mission of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee to Afghanistan has reported positive signs concerning women's rights in the country. The mission was sent to Afghanistan last week to look into the effects of the ban on women being employed in national and local and international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and humanitarian work that was promulgated by the Taliban on Dec. 24, 2022. Days after the Dec. 24 edict, the Afghanistan minister of public health said this edict would not apply in the health sector. That was followed a few days later by a similar exception in the education sector. So there already was a record of exceptions, said UN Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths, who chairs the committee and led the mission to Afghanistan. ""And in addition to making clear our grave concern about the edict itself, we then also said, okay, if you're not rescinding the edict now, then we must expand these exceptions to cover all the aspects of humanitarian action. And that was the agenda with which we met all those de facto Taliban leaders,"" Griffiths told a press briefing on Monday. He said the mission spent several days in Kabul and met with nine Taliban leaders, including the de facto acting foreign minister, the de facto acting economy minister, the first and the second deputy prime ministers, and the interior minister. ""So we expressed our opposition to the ban, hope for it to be rescinded, and in the meantime asked for further sectors to be granted these exceptions or authorizations for the role and the function of women,"" said Griffiths. ""In all these meetings, we were told that indeed, these such arrangements would be forthcoming ... we were asked to be patient."" The mission was told that guidelines are being developed by the Taliban authorities, which would provide allegedly the role of functioning of women in humanitarian operations, he said. ""Let's see if these guidelines do come through,"" said Griffiths, adding that ""our view is that the message has clearly been delivered that women are central, essential workers in the humanitarian sector, in addition to having rights, and we need to see them back to work."" The Inter-Agency Standing Committee is a humanitarian coordination forum of the UN system. It brings together the executive heads of 18 organizations and consortia, with members from within and outside the United Nations, to formulate policy, set strategic priorities and mobilize resources in response to humanitarian crises. At Monday's press briefing, the deputy executive director for programs at the UN Children's Fund, Omar Abdi, said there are some positive signs concerning the Taliban's ban on girls attending secondary education. Since the Dec. 20 ban, an estimated 200,000 girls have continued to attend secondary schools in around 12 provinces, and female secondary-school teachers continued to receive their salaries from the de facto authorities, he said. ""The officials we met in Kabul ... reaffirmed that they are not against girls learning in secondary schools, and again promised to reopen once the guidelines are approved by their leader,"" he said. In addition, over the last year, the number of community-based education classes taking place in private homes/public places has doubled from 10,000 to 20,000 classes. These serve about 600,000 children, of whom 55 percent are girls, said Abdi. These positive signs are the results of both commitment from the de facto authorities and pressure from local communities to keep schools and community schools open, he said. ""Without education, certainly there is no hope for a better future for girls and women of Afghanistan."" Janti Soeripto, president and chief executive officer of Save the Children U.S., called on donor countries not to freeze or withhold humanitarian funding for Afghanistan. ""Donor countries must continue to support a unified, principled response that includes men and women, and refrain from freezing or withholding this flexible funding that we so desperately need. We need the international community to stand by and not give (up) hope on the women, girls and men and boys in Afghanistan,"" she told the press briefing. If the ban on women's participation in humanitarian work isn't reversed, the consequences for the people of Afghanistan will be dire, and that's the message the mission has taken to the de facto authorities in Afghanistan, she said. As there has been some progress, her organization is hopeful that discussions across the various provinces to resume its work will continue, said Soeripto.  ",Xinhua,2023-01-31 08:50
471,"Türkiye may evaluate NATO applications of Finland, Sweden separately: FM","  ANKARA, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- Türkiye could evaluate Finland's NATO bid separately from Sweden's bid to distinguish ""between a problematic country and a less problematic one,"" the Turkish foreign minister said on Monday. ""If NATO and these countries take such a decision, we, as Türkiye, think that we may evaluate the applications separately. But first of all, NATO and these countries have to decide,"" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said at a joint press conference with his Portuguese counterpart Joao Gomes Cravinho. Cavusoglu emphasized that the alliance and these countries initially requested that the membership process of the two countries be carried out together. Since then, Finland has taken some steps, but there were ""provocations"" in Sweden, he said. ""We've been saying that we have fewer problems with Finland since the two countries' application process started. It would be fair to distinguish between a problematic country and a less problematic one,"" the minister explained. On Sunday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that Türkiye may show a different approach to Finland's NATO bid than Sweden. ""We may respond differently to Finland if necessary. Sweden would be shocked when we respond differently to Finland. But Finland should not make the same mistake,"" Erdogan said. Türkiye submitted a list of 120 ""terrorists"" to Sweden for extradition, Erdogan said, adding that the Nordic country must extradite these people in order to join NATO. Türkiye has postponed a trilateral meeting with Sweden and Finland on their NATO bids slated to take place in February following the burning of a copy of the Quran in Sweden.",Xinhua,2023-01-31 08:53

As part of his three-leg Middle East tour, Blinken arrived in Israel after visiting Egypt. This was his first meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu since Netanyahu returned to office in December 2022 as the leader of a new extreme-right-wing and ultra-religious government. At the airport upon his arrival, Blinken condemned the recent deadly attacks between Israelis and Palestinians. ""To take an innocent life in an act of terrorism is always a heinous crime,"" he said, adding Israeli calls for vengeance ""against more innocent victims are not the answer,"" as ""acts of retaliatory violence against civilians are never justified."" In later joint statements with Netanyahu after their meeting, Blinken urged ""all sides to take urgent steps to restore calm and to de-escalate."" ""We want to make sure that there's an environment in which we can, I hope, at some point, create the conditions where we can start to restore a sense of security for Israelis and Palestinians alike, which of course is sorely lacking,"" he said. His visit coincided with a flare of violence between Israelis and Palestinians. Since the beginning of 2023, at least 35 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces, according to official Palestinian figures. Netanyahu did not mention the regional tensions in his statement. Instead, he talked about the Iranian ""aggression"" and his wish to expand the so-called Abraham Accords signed in 2020 in which the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco agreed to normalize ties with Israel. ""Expanding the circle of peace (and) working to close the issue of the Arab-Israeli conflict, I think, would also help us achieve a workable solution with our Palestinian neighbors,"" Netanyahu said. For his part, Blinken said while the United States supports more normalization deals and the integration of Israel in the Middle East, ""these efforts are not a substitute for progress between Israelis and Palestinians."" He repeated the U.S. commitment to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. ""As we advance Israel's integration, we can do so in ways that improve the daily lives of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza,"" he said, noting Washington believes that establishing an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel is the way to move forward. Blinken also had discussions with Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen and Israeli President Isaac Herzog. The U.S. top diplomat has a scheduled trip to the Palestinian territories, where he will meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Tuesday.    ",Xinhua,2023-01-31 08:56

The leaders discussed key areas where Brussels and Rome are at odds, issues likely to be on the agenda at the upcoming Special European Council meeting. Michel had traveled to Rome in preparation for the meeting on Feb. 9-10 in Brussels. Addressing the media after closed-door talks with Michel, Meloni said current rules on migration, an area where Italy has sought stronger restrictions than those of the European Union (EU) as a whole, gave too much responsibility to countries where refugees first land in Europe. Italy is one such country, along with Greece and Spain. ""It is not in anyone's interest for countries to have a rift over an issue like migration,"" Meloni said. ""Doing so would be the same as giving a gift to those who traffic human beings."" She added: ""The European Union can and must intervene, starting from a defense of its external borders. Italy cannot manage the problem on its own."" The summit would take place at a pivotal time, Michel said. Discussions will be held on the challenge of securing adequate energy amid the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the growing problem of long-term food security, and the issue of European competitiveness amid ""the massive state aid plan that the United States is implementing"" to help bolster its economy. ""The choices we make at the next European Council meeting will be decisive over the next ten years,"" Michel said.

Resolution 2674, which won the unanimous support of the 15-member council, approves an extension of 12 months for the first time instead of the past practice of six-month renewals. The resolution affirms the Security Council's intention to continue to closely monitor the situation in Cyprus and its readiness to review the implementation of this resolution after six months and to consider any adjustments or other actions as necessary. The resolution expresses the Security Council's serious concern and alarm at the continued violations of the military status quo along the cease-fire lines and urges the sides and all involved parties to respect UNFICYP's mandated authority in, and delineation of, the buffer zone. It urgently calls on both sides to respect the integrity and inviolability of the buffer zone, to remove all unauthorized constructions and to prevent unauthorized military or civilian activities within and along the cease-fire lines. It stresses that UNFICYP's mandated authority extends throughout Cyprus, calls on all parties to continue to cooperate with UNFICYP and strongly urges full respect for UNFICYP's freedom of movement throughout Cyprus and the cessation of all restrictions on the mission's movement and access. The resolution deeply regrets the lack of progress on an effective mechanism for direct military contacts between the sides and the relevant involved parties, and urges flexibility and engagement by the sides and the relevant involved parties to develop a suitably acceptable proposal on the establishment of such a mechanism and its timely implementation. It calls on the sides to reduce existing barriers to intercommunal contact, emphasizes the importance of effective communication for risk mitigation and trust building between the communities, and urges the sides to agree and implement further confidence-building measures that can contribute to a conducive environment for settlement. The resolution fully supports the UN secretary-general's ongoing engagement with the sides and encourages further rounds of informal talks and reiterates the importance of the sides and all involved participants approaching this process in the spirit of openness, flexibility and compromise and showing the necessary political will and commitment to freely negotiate a mutually acceptable settlement under UN auspices. It continues to urge the sides to engage actively and without further delay with the secretary-general and his team to this end, and further urges the sides to reach an agreement regarding the proposal of the secretary-general to appoint a UN envoy for Cyprus. After independence in 1960, the tensions between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots increased. UNFICYP was set up by the UN Security Council in 1964 to prevent further fighting between the two sides. Turkish troops occupied the northern part of Cyprus in 1974 in reaction to a coup by Athens-backed Greek Cypriots, splitting the country into two.

480,Police violence shows racism only getting worse,"  As a white police officer in Minneapolis choked George Floyd to death by kneeling on his neck in 2020, the African American cried out ""I can't breathe"" but that didn't move his oppressor one bit. Worse, even the nationwide protests that followed Floyd's death in the United States could not deter similar crimes from taking place, as police violence claimed another African American, Tyre Nichols, this month. According to a CNN report, Nichols' family attorney claimed he suffered ""extensive bleeding caused by a severe beating"" from five policemen. On social media platforms, some argue that the Nichols incident does not constitute racism because it was five black policemen who beat him up. However, it only goes to show that colored people, African Americans in particular, suffer discrimination not only from white people, but also from people of the same color. Racial discrimination is so deeply rooted in US society that it is impossible to end it overnight. Despite the civil rights movement in the 1960s and colored people's rising sense of equality in recent years with the popularity of social media, the status of colored people in the US remains below that of their white counterparts, be it in economy, opportunities, development and everything. According to the Mapping Police Violence website, of the 1,186 people who lost their lives to police violence in the US in 2022, African Americans accounted for 26 percent, although the community accounts for 13 percent of the country's population. From 2013 to 2022, an African American has faced 2.9 times greater possibility of encountering police violence than a white American. Fifty-five years ago, renowned civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. was killed in Memphis. Now Nichols, another African American, succumbed to violence in the same city.

""We wanted to help the Malaysian people combat COVID-19 and help them return to normalcy as soon as possible,"" Li said. Chinese experts were similarly offering assistance in Iran, Italy, Pakistan, Russia, the Philippines and Peru, as well as countries in Africa, a feat that embodied the vision of building a global community of health for all, according to the Foreign Ministry. Wang Xiaotao, former director of China International Development Cooperation Agency, said that many countries had donated valuable supplies to China when it was hit hard, and it was heartwarming for China to return the favor. ""Even when facing a serious COVID-19 situation at home, China promptly launched an emergency humanitarian aid effort, the largest of its kind since the nation's founding,"" Wang wrote in an article in Foreign Affairs Journal, which is published by the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs. ""The COVID-19 pandemic recognizes no borders and ethnicities. It is a common enemy of humanity and can only be overcome with solidarity and collaboration,"" Wang wrote. ""China will never stand aloof from a friend in need, nor will it attach conditions for selfish gains when extending a helping hand."" Mi Feng, spokesman for the National Health Commission, said in a news briefing in mid-January that China has promptly shared vital information with the world, and that served as the scientific basis for developing vaccines and diagnosis tools. These vital pieces of information included confirming the pathogen was a novel coronavirus, sharing the genome sequence of the virus and publishing China's treatment and prevention plans, he said. China has provided massive quantities of medical supplies for 153 countries and 15 international organizations, Mi said. It also held over 300 exchanges on COVID-19 control measures and medical treatment with over 180 countries and regions and over 10 international organizations. Mi said that China was the first country to propose the COVID-19 vaccine as a global public good and the first to cooperate in vaccine production with developing countries. He added that China had provided over 2.2 billion vaccines for over 120 countries and international organizations. ""We are willing to continue to work with the international community to jointly tackle the pandemic and better safeguard the health and well-being of people in various countries,"" Mi said. At the same news briefing, Wu Xi, director-general of the Department of Consular Affairs of the Foreign Ministry, said that China has maintained an open, transparent and responsible attitude when sharing its data with the international community, including holding over 60 technical exchanges with the World Health Organization, five of which were recently held. On Jan 14, Ma Xiaowei, head of the National Health Commission, spoke with WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus about the COVID-19 situation in China. The WHO said in a statement that Chinese officials provided it information on the COVID-19 situation in the country and also made the information public through a news conference. The information shared covered a range of topics, including outpatient clinics, hospitalization, patients requiring emergency treatment and critical care, and deaths related to COVID-19 infection in hospitals. ""The WHO will continue to work with China, providing technical advice and support and engaging in analyzing the situation,"" the statement added. Qian Yuming, an assistant researcher at the Department for International and Strategic Studies of the China Institute of International Studies, said that China has made an ""irreplaceable and irrefutable"" contribution to the global fight against COVID-19 by providing necessary aid and by building confidence and hope. Last year, the BRICS nations — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — launched a new vaccine research and development center to enhance collaboration in the areas to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. Mikhail Murashko, Russia's health minister, said in a video address to the launch event that the center showcases the BRICS' commitment to assisting the global population and making vaccines more accessible and affordable for developing countries. Ahmed Ogwell Ouma, acting director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, said that China's collaborations with countries such as Egypt, Algeria and Morocco offered alternative sources of COVID-19 vaccines to people on the African continent, especially at the height of the pandemic in the middle of 2021. The partnership has enabled the continent to produce the vaccines locally, thus reducing the need for importing and transporting vaccines from outside the continent, he told Xinhua News Agency. Sergio Held, a journalist based in Colombia, said that Chinese vaccines brought life in Latin America back to normal, as the Rio de Janeiro Carnival in Brazil made a comeback in April 2022 after being canceled the year before due to the pandemic. Mehmood ul Hassan Khan, executive director of the Center for South Asia &International Studies in Islamabad, Pakistan, said that China's optimization of its COVID-19 control measures will unleash the vitality of its economy and bolster the international community's confidence in its development potential. ""China has proactively facilitated the optimization of the global public health governance,"" he wrote in an article published in People's Daily.",Chinadaily.com.cn,2023-02-01 08:16
489,Palestinians protest Blinken's visit amid rising Israeli-Palestinian tensions in West Bank,"  RAMALLAH/GAZA, Jan. 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to the West Bank prompted outrage among many Palestinians, who demonstrated on Tuesday to express their opposition to the U.S. top diplomat's presence in the Palestinian territory. The protesters, both in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, raised the Palestinian flags and chanted anti-U.S. slogans, accusing it of being biased toward Israel and all its violations of Palestinian rights. ""The matter is very simple. Blinken came here to pressure the Palestinian leadership to not adopt any decision against the security cooperation with Israel,"" said Nael Salama, who took part in a protest in the West Bank city of Ramallah carrying a banner of ""The U.S. is criminal as long as it supports Israel.""   ""We came here to deliver our message to Blinken that he is not welcome in our country as his administration's full bias towards Israel and its practices against the Palestinian people,"" Issam Baker, the coordinator of the national and Islamic forces in Ramallah, told Xinhua. He emphasized that the U.S. administration used ""double standards"" in dealing with the Palestinian issue, adding that it will ""only lead to further continuation of the cycle of violence."" Since the start of 2023, Israeli forces have killed at least 35 Palestinians, making January one of the most deadly months in the West Bank in recent years. Most casualties occurred during Israeli military raids, which Israel says aimed to detain Palestinian militants.   In retaliation, a shooting attack launched by a Palestinian gunman outside a synagogue in an Israeli settlement in East Jerusalem claimed the lives of seven people on Friday night. Ahmed Abu Dalfa, a protester in the Gaza Strip, told Xinhua that Blinken's visit will not bring benefits to the Palestinian people because Washington is ""abandoning"" its promises to Palestine. Earlier in the day, Blinken held a meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the Palestinian presidential headquarters in Ramallah after his meetings with Israeli leaders on Monday. Blinken urged both the Palestinians and Israelis to calm tensions while reiterating Washington's ""ironclad"" commitment to Israel's security. Following his meeting with Blinken, Abbas said that the Israeli government ""is fully responsible for the current tension and violence in the Palestinian territories"" because it has undermined the two-state solution and violated the signed agreements. Abbas also accused the international community of failing to end Israel's military occupation of the Palestinian territories and its settlement policy in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.",Xinhua,2023-02-01 08:48
760,U.S. consumer confidence drops in January as possible recession looms,"   WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumers rang in the first month of the new year a little less confidently, according to data released on Tuesday. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index fell to 107.1 in January, a slight dip from 109 in the month prior. ""Consumer confidence declined in January, but it remains above the level seen last July, lowest in 2022,"" said Ataman Ozyildirim, senior director, economics at The Conference Board. ""Consumer confidence fell the most for households earning less than 15,000 (U.S. dollars) and for households aged under 35."" The organization's present situation index, a measure of consumers' assessment of labor and business trends, climbed to 150.9 from 147.4 last month. However, the expectations index, a measure of consumers' short-run views on income, labor and business conditions, fell to 77.8 from last month's 83.4. All this comes as economists predict a possible recession in this year's second half. The data was released a day before the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates.",Xinhua,2023-02-01 09:07
763,"Mass shootings, deadly law enforcement expose U.S. culture of violence","NEW YORK, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- The mass shootings in Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay in California as well as Tyre Nichols' death from deadly law enforcement in Memphis, Tennessee, expose once again the violent root in U.S. culture. From the astonishing number of people killed every year because of gun violence to deaths due to police's lethal force, these tragedies speaking more than racism, police brutality and control of guns, but a fact that the culture of violence is deeply rooted in the Untied States.  The state of California has been in sorrow due to a series of deadly shootings recently. On the Eve of the Chinese Lunar New Year, 11 people were killed in a mass shooting in Monterey Park in Los Angeles County. Two days later, another two shootings happened in the coastal northern California city of Half Moon Bay, leaving seven people dead and one critically injured.   The United States has reported 3,507 deaths from gun violence in the first 30 days of 2023 with 51 mass shootings recorded, according to Gun Violence Archive, a website that tracks shootings in the country. ""We have the highest rates of gun deaths in the world. We have more guns than people ... We have more than one gun for every man, woman and child in America. That is insanity,"" Paul Cole Padilla, an educational administrator, told Xinhua. The over-used violence in the United States can also be seen in its police department. Tyre Nichols, 29, was beaten by police after a traffic stop on Jan. 7 in Memphis, Tennessee, where they allegedly stopped him for reckless driving. The African American man died at a hospital three days after the confrontation, during which Nichols was punched and kicked while being restrained. He pleaded to go home and kept yelling ""mom."" ""What happened here does not at all reflect proper policing. This was wrong. This was criminal,"" said David Rausch, director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, who told reporters on Friday that he saw the video before it was released to the public and found it ""absolutely appalling.  It is not racism but culturism driving this, it is a culture in law enforcement where it is OK to be aggressive to those they are supposed to serve, said Robert Sausedo, the head of Community Build Inc, a Los Angeles-based non-profit organization. No race or ethnic group has a monopoly on violence. No group is immune to our society's obsession and love affair with guns. No group is exempt from mental health challenges or despair, said Naomi Ishisaka, The Seattle Times' assistant managing editor. ""We have to talk about this institutionalized police culture that has this unwritten law,"" Ben Crump, the lawyer for Nichols' family, said in a television interview. ""As much as those five officers killed Tyre Nichols, it was the police culture in America that killed Tyre Nichols,"" Crump said, calling for systematic change among all police officers regardless of the color of their skin.  The culture of violence in the United States manifests on various fronts in the society. America's culture of violence goes deeper than race, and the single-minded focus on race is not helping to resolve some of the problems, said Bill Maher, host of HBO political talk show Real Time. Speaking on the tragedies from the mass shootings in Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay to Tyre Nichols' death, Maher said ""I guess what I'm asking is America's culture of violence -- it does go deeper than race, right?""   ""And I think this mono-focus we have on race is short-circuiting us trying to fix some of the realer problems,"" Maher added. ""Can American culture rethink itself -- can it transcend its belief that enemies are always out there, needing to be obliterated,"" said Robert C. Koehler, a Chicago-based journalist and nationally syndicated writer, adding that violence presents itself, in people's imaginations, games, movies and defense budget, as consequence-free, instantaneous and necessary. The culture of violence has intensified since the 1980s and has found a privileged place in the cult of authoritarianism in the United States, said Henry A. Giroux, an American-Canadian scholar and culture critic. ""As society is increasingly militarized under neoliberalism, violence becomes the solution for everything. This is especially dangerous for those individuals who feel isolated and lonely in a society that atomizes everything,"" Giroux said. American culture of violence is distinct in its scale and nature, noted Steven Beschloss, a U.S. writer, journalist and filmmaker. Giroux said the ideological and structural conditions that nourish and legitimate violence have to be revealed both in their connections to power and in the systemic unmasking of those who benefit from such death-dealing conditions. ""We have to make sure that the culture not only respects the policy, but the culture respects the community. Policy means nothing if you have a culture that is rotten,"" Crump said.",Xinhua,2023-02-01 09:11
455,Bangladesh raises electricity prices to ease subsidy burden,"DHAKA, Jan. 31 (Xinhua) -- In an apparent bid to ease the subsidy burden, the Bangladeshi government has again raised the prices of power at both the wholesale and retail levels. The new rates will come into effect from Feb. 1, 2023, according to a notice from the ministry of power, energy and mineral resources. The retail price of electricity will be raised by 5 percent for the second time in less than a month while the wholesale prices are seeing an increase of 8.06 percent, according to the notice. The Bangladeshi government on Jan. 12 raised the electricity price at the retail level by 5 percent to 7.48 taka per unit on a weighted average, ignoring opposition from businesses and consumers. The move to raise the retail price of electricity on Jan. 12 came after the price was hiked by 19.92 percent at the producers' level in December last year. Bangladeshi State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid had earlier said that backlog made due to financial losses in gas import would be likely overcome to some extent if the power price adjustment is made on a monthly basis. Experts claimed the markup in power prices would likely push up the nation's inflation rate again. Inflation in Bangladesh accelerated to 9.52 percent in August last year, the highest in 10 years, mainly driven by higher food prices, the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics reported.

488,WWII sex slavery victims in Philippines urge Japan to recognize war crimes,"MANILA, Jan. 31 (Xinhua) -- Surviving Filipino women sexually enslaved by Japan's World War II military on Tuesday urged the Japanese government to acknowledge its war crimes, resolve the ""comfort women"" issue, and stop ""warmongering."" ""It is very unjust on the part of the Japanese government to continue ignoring the issue of Filipino comfort women who have suffered long enough, more than half a century in silence,"" Sharon Cabusao-Silva, the executive director of Lila Pilipina, told reporters. Lila Pilipina is a Philippine organization helping women forced into Japanese military brothels in their fight for justice. There are only a few survivors, and most are in their 90s and sick. Silva said Japan must recognize the trauma inflicted on the women by the Japanese Imperial Army. ""We urge Japan to finally acknowledge its war crimes against Asian nations and take the necessary steps toward a fair and long-overdue resolution of the 'comfort women' issue,"" the group said. Lila Pilipina's call came when Japan was set to present its human rights report for the Fourth Cycle of the United Nations' Universal Periodic Review of Human Rights in the country. ""We are outraged that Japan has chosen to ignore once again the issue of its wartime military sex slavery of thousands of Asian women in the fourth human rights report it submitted to the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC),"" it added. While declaring its achievements in various human rights areas, the Japanese government was utterly silent about the ""comfort women"" system which is also at the core of these issues, the group said. The group added Japan ""totally ignored"" the recommendations made by other countries ""for Japan to finally address this long-standing issue."" The group sounded the alarm over Japan's ""aggressive actions toward war spending and production with the development of its missile and other defense capabilities."" The group also expressed alarm ""by how Japan has militarized its Official Development Assistance programs in the Philippines through the sale of war material."" As living witnesses and victims of war, Narcisa Claveria and Estelita Dy said they experienced cruelty and hardships during World War II at the hands of the Japanese military. ""We were abused, forced to wash and iron their clothes by day, and repeatedly raped at night by Japanese soldiers. That is why I reject war,"" Claveria told reporters. ""War is brutal; you will suffer even if you have not done anything wrong because they accuse you of doing something even if you did not,"" she added. Estelita Dy said the new generation must not experience war. ""We do not want the new generation to experience the atrocities of war; what we went through during the war, so we are against war,"" she told reporters. During World War II, hundreds of thousands of women and girls from China, the Korean Peninsula, Southeast Asia and other countries and regions were forcibly conscripted by Japanese militarists as sex slaves and experienced horrific sexual violence, both mentally and physically.",Xinhua,2023-02-01 09:20
483,Chinese national killed in gunmen attack in Ethiopia,"ADDIS ABABA, Jan. 31 (Xinhua) -- One Chinese national has been shot dead by unidentified gunmen in Ethiopia's Oromia region, the Chinese Embassy in Ethiopia confirmed on Tuesday. The incident happened on Monday evening when nine Chinese nationals were attacked in the Gebre Guracha town in the northern part of the Oromia region, about 160 km from Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. One of them was shot dead eventually, the embassy said in a statement. Even though large-scale military conflicts have stopped in Ethiopia, ethnic and religious conflicts remain acute in some parts of the country. In the border areas between Oromia and other regions, in particular, armed attacks, kidnappings, robberies and other vicious cases have occurred frequently, causing a large number of casualties and posing high security risks. The Chinese Embassy in Ethiopia called on Chinese citizens and institutions in the East African country to be vigilant, avoid negligence, build a strong security awareness, stay away from high-risk areas, and not travel to or pass through high-risk areas.",Xinhua,2023-02-01 09:37
456,Facts about Russia-Ukraine conflict: Ukraine exports 19 mln tons of foodstuffs under grain deal,"KIEV/MOSCOW/WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are the latest developments in the Ukraine crisis: Ukraine's Black Sea ports have shipped 19 million tons of foodstuffs since August under a key deal on grain and fertilizer exports, the government-run Ukrinform news agency reported Tuesday, citing a senior official. Ukraine exports about 3 million tons of grain and other agricultural products per month from its three Black Sea ports, said the country's Deputy Agriculture Minister Markiyan Dmytrasevych. Ukraine's ports of Odesa, Chornomorsk, and Pivdenny have the capacity to supply abroad about 6 million tons of foodstuffs monthly, Dmytrasevych added. - - - - The Russian defense ministry said Tuesday that the country's forces continued to advance in the Kupyansk, Krasny Liman, Kherson, Donetsk, and South Donetsk directions. Over 195 Ukrainian soldiers were killed as a result of the offensives, and certain number of Ukrainian tanks, armored combat vehicles, ammunition depots, howitzers and artillery systems have been destroyed. Russian forces also shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter and destroyed five drones, it added. - - - - U.S. President Joe Biden said on Monday that he won't approve sending F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine. ""No,"" Biden said in response to a question about the possibility of such a decision.

457,"Blinken wraps up visit to Jerusalem, West Bank, with little progress in ending Israeli-Palestinian violence","JERUSALEM/GAZA, Jan. 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken concluded his visit to Jerusalem and the West Bank on Tuesday, with little progress made in de-escalating the Israeli-Palestinian tensions, experts said. Blinken's trip, during which he met with leaders of Israel's new right-wing government and the Palestinian Authority (PA), came amid escalating violence between Israelis and the Palestinians. Since the start of 2023, Israeli forces have killed at least 35 Palestinians, making January one of the most deadly months in the West Bank in recent years. Most casualties occurred during Israeli military raids, which Israel says aimed to detain Palestinian militants. In retaliation, a shooting attack launched by a Palestinian gunman outside a synagogue in an Israeli settlement in East Jerusalem claimed the lives of seven people on Friday night. On Monday, Blinken held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem and other senior officials before traveling on Tuesday to the West Bank city of Ramallah to meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. In both places, Blinken urged de-escalating the tensions and renewed the call for a two-state solution to the conflict. ""The rising tide of violence has resulted in the loss of many innocent lives on both sides,"" he told reporters in Jerusalem. ""All sides must take steps to prevent further escalation of violence.""  The top U.S. diplomat's trip failed to offer any new initiative to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Michael Milshtein, an expert from the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies at the Tel Aviv University, told Xinhua. Milshtein said the Israeli government was hopeful that Blinken will exert pressure on Abbas to renew the security coordination between the PA and Israel. The PA decided on Jan. 26 to end security coordination with Israel in response to an Israeli military raid in the West Bank city of Jenin, in which Israeli forces killed ten Palestinians. The security coordination, which is criticized by many Palestinians, has led to the arrests of some Palestinians who were allegedly planning attacks against Israelis. In a statement issued after meeting with Blinken, Abbas made no indication he was going to resume the coordination. He accused Israel of violating Palestinians' rights, promoting annexation of the West Bank, and demolishing Palestinian homes -- moves that pose further hurdles to achieving a peace deal. ""We have found that the Israeli government is responsible for what's happening these days,"" Abbas said. Assaf Meydani, a professor at the Lauder School of Government, Diplomacy and Strategy of the Reichman University in Herzliya, told Xinhua that ""negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority in the current situation is impossible, even the United States knows it."" On the other hand, Blinken's visit also had limited impact on the Israeli side, which has a new hawkish government that is unlikely to dial down its position against the Palestinians. ""The situation inside Israel makes the current government go to more 'extreme' to ensure its survival for the longest possible period, and therefore it will continue to escalate, and in return, there will be a Palestinian reaction,"" said Ghassan al-Khatib, a political science professor at the Birzeit University in the West Bank city of Ramallah. The visit, which marked the first meeting between Blinken and Netanyahu since the latter returned to office in December as the leader of a new right-wing government, was seen as part of Washington's efforts to navigate through the differences between the Biden administration and the new Israeli government. His trip followed the visits to Jerusalem by Biden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and CIA Director William Burns earlier in January.  Al-Khatib also noted that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is not a priority for the U.S. as its attention is occupied by ""other internal and external issues."" The Palestinians have repeatedly called on Washington, as Blinken promised in 2021, to reopen the U.S. consulate for Palestinians in Jerusalem and the PLO office in Washington. They also urged the U.S. to pressure Israel to preserve the status quo in Jerusalem and stop Israeli unilateral measures or withholding Palestinian tax revenue dues. But the U.S. administration led by President Joe Biden has remained largely acquiescent regarding the escalation of Israeli violence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, while failing to fulfill any of its promises made either during the election campaign or in bilateral meetings with Palestinian officials, analysts noted. Milshtein said that the U.S. does not prioritize the Palestinian issues anymore, adding the attention of Washington is occupied elsewhere, mainly its internal issues as well as the Ukrainian crisis. Ziyad Abu Ziyad, a think-tanker and former Palestinian minister, said that the U.S. is not interested in ending the Israeli occupation or the conflicts in the region despite its talk of a two-state solution and positive steps to solve the Palestinian issue. He added that it's time for anyone who bets on a U.S. solution to the Palestinian issue to ""realize that this was nothing but a mirage."" The last round of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks ended without progress due to deep differences on several key issues in March 2014, since which Washington has made no real push to renew the stalled peace process despite the recurrent violence and conflicts between the Israelis and Palestinians.",Xinhua,2023-02-01 10:47
458,Australian nuclear agency joins search for lost radioactive capsule,"CANBERRA, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- Australia's nuclear regulatory agency has joined the search for a radioactive capsule missing in the outback. In a statement on Tuesday, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) confirmed that it has started working with authorities in Western Australia (WA) to locate the capsule. The eight-millimeter caesium-137 capsule, which is part of a gauge used to measure the density of iron ore, was reported missing along a route in remote WA in January, prompting a radiation alert for a large part of the state and an emergency search. Authorities have started retracing the route of the capsule which went missing while being transported from a mining site to a storage facility in Perth. The ARPANSA said it has sent a deployment team with specialized car-mounted and portable radiation detection equipment to help with the search. ""This equipment and expertise form part of ARPANSA's national radiation protection and emergency response capability,"" the agency said in a statement. ""The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) has also sent deployment teams of radiation services specialists, detection and imaging equipment to assist in the search,"" the statement said. Members of the public have been warned to stay at least five meters away from the capsule if they find it, with direct contact likely to cause radiation burns or sickness.",Xinhua,2023-02-01 13:03
459,"Chaos, distrust, frustration -- Three years on, Britain still troubled by Brexit crisis","   LONDON, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- This January, three years after its departure from the European Union (EU) in 2020, Britain still suffers from division with parliament members continuing to pressure the prime minister on Brexit's consequences during their weekly conventions. ""It's clear that Brexit and its hold over British politics remains strong,"" noted Sophie Stowers from the academic network UK in a Changing Europe. ""Britain has been split into two distinct camps: 'Leavers' and 'Remainers'."" Brexit chaos has showed no sign of stopping. The divorce has turned out to be long and unpleasant, full of quarrels and distrust, both inside Britain as well as between it and the bloc. As much evidence has showed, the British economy has suffered much, and frustration has grown over the unfulfilled promises. Worse yet, no quick solution is in sight.  ""There's now a reasonable consensus that the effects of Brexit on the UK economy have been negative,"" Professor Iain Begg from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) told Xinhua. ""It's more an incremental, small, bit-by-bit, drip-by-drip effect on the British economy. But it's mainly been in one direction of being negative."" Evidence abounds that both households and businesses have been hit hard. Brexit added an average of 210 pounds (258.4 U.S. dollars) to household food bills in the EU over the two years to the end of 2021, and cost British consumers a total of 5.8 billion pounds (7.1 billion dollars) with higher food bills, research from the LSE Centre for Economic Performance showed in December 2022.   ""And since low-income households spend a greater share of their income on food than richer families, these Brexit-driven price rises had a proportionately greater impact on the poorest people,"" the study added. Companies have also felt the blow. Nearly half businesses still found Brexit challenging, while only a third could envisage opportunities materializing from Brexit, a report published by the Institute of Directors in November 2022 showed. Businesses said that they have lost clients as a result of Brexit, and that they have had to divert supply chains and relocate to the EU to keep trading, said the report, noting that EU firms are pulling out of Britain as an export market because of the barriers. ""Businesses feel they are banging their heads against a brick wall as nothing has been done to help them,"" said Shevaun Haviland, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. ""The longer the current problems go unchecked, the more EU traders go elsewhere, and the more damage is done."" Brexit has inevitably led to tax rises as well, because a slower-growing economy requires higher taxation to fund public services and benefits, said deputy director John Springford at the think tank Centre for European Reform. If Brexit had not happened, he added, most of the tax rises that the government announced in March 2022 would not have been necessary. A report published by think tank Resolution Foundation in June 2022 found that since 2019, Britain had experienced a sharp decline of 8 percentage points in trade openness, or total trade as a share of GDP. It's estimated that labor productivity will be reduced by 1.3 percent by the end of the decade due to changes in trading rules alone. While the debate on the impact of Brexit has implied a one-off shock, adjustment will be gradual and create a lasting impact on Britain's competitiveness and productivity over the coming decade, the report noted.  One of the illusory promises of Brexit was it would enable Britain to cut quick-and-easy trade deals, but this has not happened with the EU, by far its largest partner, nor with the United States, said John Kampfner from the policy institute Chatham House in a December 2022 article.   ""Considerable effort, and resource, has been expended on devising an independent trade policy. Once again, the results are limited,"" Kampfner noted. ""Much of Brexit's Global Britain dream was based on reviving deeper relationships with the Commonwealth. Again, this is proving harder than originally envisaged."" The reality is that the vast majority of the 71 deals reached since Brexit are rollover agreements with countries that already had trade agreements with the EU, according to researcher Stephen Hunsaker at the UK in a Changing Europe in January. Even though the existing UK-Japan agreement was slightly modified, analysts cautioned that it will provide no net gain compared to the EU-Japan deal, Hunsaker added. Also, migration was quite a big deal in Brexit debates, but two years on from the end of free movement, the level of net migration certainly has not fallen, said Torsten Bell, chief executive at the Resolution Foundation. Statistics show net migration continued to add to the population in the year ending June 2022, with an estimated 504,000 more people arriving long-term to the UK than departing. ""EU migration has decreased sharply, while there has been a substantial increase in non-EU migration. Combined with other factors, this has led to migration overall running at record levels,"" said a report published by UK in a Changing Europe in January. ""The new system has seen increases in work visas in the health sector, and some other high-skilled service sectors, while other sectors, such as hospitality, which were previously more dependent on EU workers, are seeing labour shortages,"" it added. Regrets have been growing. The number of Leave voters who think it was wrong for Britain to vote leave the EU has been steadily increasing since 2021, hitting a record 19 percent in November 2022, YouGov data showed, identifying the top reason as ""just a general sense that things have gotten worse since Brexit."" Simon Wolfson, chief executive of the retailer Next, called for more foreign workers in Britain during a recent media interview. It is ""not the Brexit I wanted,"" said the Brexit supporter.  A dispute over the Northern Ireland Protocol, the rules governing post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland, has strained Britain's relations with the EU, even stoking worries of a trade war. Tension grew when the British government in June 2022 introduced a bill to unilaterally change parts of the protocol, which the EU said was not acceptable.   Under the protocol, Northern Ireland is part of British customs territory but is subject to the EU's customs code, value-added tax rules and single market rules for goods. However, a de facto Irish Sea border was thus created between the British mainland and Northern Ireland, meaning goods transported to and from Northern Ireland are subject to border controls. This has elicited firm opposition from Northern Ireland's pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party, which has demanded the removal or replacement of the protocol as a precondition for it to sit in the assembly and form a devolved government. Political chaos has continued. The British government's approach to resolving the problems with the protocol has been counterproductive and has further undermined trust, said Hilary Benn, the Labour Member of Parliament for Leeds Central, in September 2022. ""One of the most striking features of Brexit is that those who argued most strongly for it appear unwilling to take any responsibility for its consequences. Nowhere has this been demonstrated more clearly than in the case of the Northern Ireland Protocol,"" Benn noted. More recently, with efforts to heal the rifts, progress was made in Britain-EU talks.

The central bank hiked rates by a quarter percentage point, marking the eighth time the Fed has raised rates since it began tightening in March last year. ""Inflation has eased somewhat but remains elevated,"" the Fed said in a press release. The Fed is engaged in the most aggressive rate hike cycle in many years, in a bid to quell the worst inflation in four decades.

461,EU unveils green industry deal to compete with U.S.,"   BRUSSELS, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on Wednesday unveiled its plan to meet the challenges posed by the United States'(U.S.) Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and keep up with a worldwide race in subsidy schemes for green industries. Net-zero industries are most important in the fight against climate change, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said when presenting the Green Deal Industrial Plan. The plan is built on four pillars: a conducive regulatory environment for the net-zero industries, national and EU funding, ensuring proper skills for the green transition and an ambitious trade agenda. It is designed to ease restrictions on state aid and unlock huge private financing for clean-tech production in the European Union (EU).   To that end, the European Commission will have to consult with EU countries to amend the current state aid framework, including increasing notification thresholds for the support of green investments. Margrethe Vestager, executive vice president of the Commission and commissioner for competition, cautioned that the proposed amendment should be temporary, well targeted in size and scope, and pending real benefits. ""So it comes with a risk. Some countries will be able to deliver far more money than others,"" said Vestager. She said the new provisions should match those sectors affected by the IRA -- and those only -- such as batteries for electric vehicles and wind turbines.   EU countries have generally agreed that part of the IRA, Joe Biden's 369-billion-U.S. dollar package, is a threat to the competitiveness of specific key sectors for the green transition of the European industry, according to Vestager. Faced with the dual challenges of surging energy prices following the Russian-Ukraine conflict and the potential relocation of European green industries induced by the IRA, the EU has chosen to carefully nurture rather than damage its relationship with the U.S.. Von der Leyen argued in her speech on Wednesday that the EU countries ""welcome"" the U.S. bill, and that ""the fight against climate change is a must.""   But she insisted in the meantime that there should be a level playing field in the global competition and in the EU's single market. ""This is so important for us,"" she added. Von der Leyen said the Commission's proposals would be debated during the EU summit next week.",Xinhua,2023-02-02 09:07
463,Missing radioactive capsule found in Australian outback after 6-day search,"SYDNEY. Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- Authorities in the Western Australia state (WA) confirmed that the tiny silver capsule, which contained the radioactive substance Caesium-137, was found and safely controlled at about 11:00 a.m. local time on Wednesday. ""We successfully retrieved the radioactive capsule after searching hundreds of kilometers in the outback and the metro area over the last six days. The capsule was located just south of Newman on the Great Northern Highway. It was two meters from the side of the road,"" said Darren Klemm, Fire and Emergency Services commissioner. Klemm told reporters that the vehicle was traveling at 70 km/h when specialist equipment picked up radiation emitted from the capsule, and the search team then used portable detection equipment to locate the capsule. ""The Australian Defence Force is currently verifying the capsule using its serial number. A 20-meter hot zone has been set up around the capsule and it will be placed into a lead container to shield from radiation. It will be stored in a secure location in Newman tonight before being transported to a WA Health Facility in Perth tomorrow,"" Klemm said. Authorities had warned that the capsule posed a significant public health risk, warning that anyone who came too close or touched it without protection could suffer from radiation burns or sickness. ""Once the capsule has been secured, we will survey the site to ensure there is no contamination in the surrounding area,"" said Klemm. ""In extremely unlikely circumstance that the capsule leaks we will remediate the area."" Following that, the emergency services updated its public warning, saying that the radioactive substance in parts of Pilbara, Midwest Gascoyne, Goldfields-Midlands and Perth Metropolitan regions is controlled and contained. According to the emergency department, the 6 mm by 8 mm capsule was packaged on Jan. 10 to be sent to Perth for repair before leaving the site for transport by road on Jan. 12. The package holding the capsule arrived in Perth on Jan. 16 and was unloaded and stored in the licensed service provider's secure radiation store. On Jan. 25, the gauge was unpacked for inspection. Upon opening the package, it was found that the gauge was broken apart with one of the four mounting bolts missing and the source itself and all screws on the gauge also missing. Mining company Rio Tinto on Sunday apologized for losing the capsule and launched an investigation over the incident. ""We are taking this incident very seriously. We recognize this is clearly very concerning and are sorry for the alarm it has caused in the Western Australian community,"" said Rio Tinto Iron Ore Chief Executive Officer Simon Trott. In an article published in the Conversation, Edward Obbard, senior lecturer in nuclear engineering from the University of New South Wales, noted that Caesium-137 is a dangerous but useful radioactive isotope that spits out electrons (or beta radiation) and high-energy photons (or gamma radiation), which can be used in some cancer treatments, for measuring the thickness of metal or the flow of liquids, and for calibrating radiation gauges. The missing capsule has a radioactive load of 19 giga-becquerels, which means it emits about 19 billion high-energy photons per second, said the scholar, warning that the most danger would occur if the capsule was broken open. ""Caesium-137 has a half-life of just over 30 years, which means the source's radiation output will halve every 30 years until it disappears completely,"" said Obbard.",Xinhua,2023-02-02 09:25

Nichols, a 29-year-old African American man, was pronounced dead in hospital on Jan. 10, three days after a traffic stop by Memphis police. Footage released by Memphis authorities last week showed officers brutally punching and kicking Nichols even when he was subdued. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris told Nichols' family at the funeral service on Wednesday that Americans ""mourn with you"" while calling for police reform. American civil rights figure Al Sharpton delivered the eulogy for Nichols, saying that they will continue to fight for justice and ""won't stop until we hold you accountable and change the system."" Five Memphis police officers involved in the death of Nichols were fired after an internal investigation and are facing criminal charges, including second-degree murder. The Memphis Police Department's so-called SCORPION unit, to which the fired officers belonged, has been permanently deactivated. The fallout has also reached other agencies, including the Memphis Fire Department, which fired three emergency medical technicians. Two additional Memphis police officers have recently been relieved of duty. ""My brother was robbed of his life, his passions, and his talents, but not his light,"" Keyana Dixon, a sister of Nichols, said on Wednesday. ""I see the world showing him love and fighting for his justice,"" Dixon said through tears. ""But all I want is my baby brother back.""   The death of Nichols came nearly three years after the police murder of African American man George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Floyd, 46, died on May 25, 2020, after an encounter with Minneapolis police, during which white officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes while making an arrest with other colleagues. The police killing of Floyd sparked outrage and protests across the United States in the summer of 2020 against police brutality and systemic racism. Police killed 1,186 people in the United States last year, according to Mapping Police Violence. African Americans were 26 percent of those killed by police in 2022 despite accounting for only 13 percent of the population.",Xinhua,2023-02-02 11:18

Awareness on the issue must also be raised, Musonda Mumba, secretary general of the Convention on Wetlands, said on the occasion of World Wetlands Day. Nearly 90 percent of the world's wetlands have been degraded or lost, Mumba said, ""meaning we are losing wetlands three times faster than forests."" ""There is an urgency to raise global awareness on wetlands to arrest and reverse their rapid loss, and encourage actions to restore and conserve these vital ecosystems,"" she emphasized.   The world only has seven years left to meet the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, she added. The Convention called on individuals to make conscious choices to minimize their own impact on wetlands, to educate and activate others to get involved in wetland restoration, and join wetland restoration efforts locally. Mumba recommended that governments and other stakeholders should create a national inventory of wetlands, set specific targets for wetland restoration, and promote good management practices.   Wetlands support critical ecosystems and biodiversity on earth, since 40 percent of all plant and animal species live or breed in wetlands. They are also vital to human life, as wetlands are not only crucial to agriculture and fisheries, but also act as water sources and purifiers, and protect our shores.

Twelve African countries have joined the alliance in the first phase. They are Angola, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Representatives from the 12 African countries committed themselves and laid out their plans to end AIDS in children by 2030 as international partners set out how they would support countries in delivering on those plans, which were issued at the first ministerial meeting of the Global Alliance to end AIDS in children in Montreal in Canada in Aug. 2022.

We know the handlers and the operators as well."" Talking about how the suicide bomber managed to get into the highly sensitive area of the city, Ansari said the attacker was clad in a police uniform, and the personnel at the entrance gate let him in thinking he is associated with the police force. ""At about 12:37 p.m. he (suicide bomber) arrived at the main gate on a motorcycle wearing helmet, came inside, talked to a constable and asked him where the mosque is. This means that the attacker was not aware of the area ... he was given a target and there is an entire network behind him,"" the official said. He said the head of the suicide bomber and ball bearings used in a suicide jacket have been recovered from the debris of the damaged mosque, adding that 10-12 kg of highly explosive TNT were used in the explosion. The blast was so powerful that the shockwaves did not find ways to escape, causing the roof of the mosque building crashing down on worshippers, a major reason behind the large number of casualties, he added. He said the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar faction of the banned Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) is behind the attack according to evidences collected so far. ""The TTP claimed responsibility for the blast for which the reasons are clear. But then they disowned it.

450,"Tyre Nichols' death once again exposes U.S. scars of police brutality, racial prejudice","NEW YORK, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- The past week has witnessed the nightly tides of street protests across the United States in the aftermath of the death of Tyre Nichols, which once again exposed the country's long-standing scars of police brutality and racial prejudice. In a statement issued on Jan. 27. U.S. President Joe Biden said he ""was outraged and deeply pained"" by the incident, calling it ""yet another painful reminder of the profound fear and trauma, the pain, and the exhaustion that Black and Brown Americans experience every single day."" Over again, federal officials and politicians vowed to ""do everything in our power"" to end such tragedy. However, similar incidents always take place from time to time in the country that is self-claimed as the ""beacon of democracy.""  Mostly peaceful protests over police brutality were carried out around the country after the public release of body camera footage brought the police killing of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee, into clearer picture. Nichols, a 29-year-old Black motorist, was pulled over on Jan. 7 for what police said was reckless driving. After attempting to flee on foot, Nichols was aggressively beaten by police, newly released police video showed. Three days later, he died in the hospital. Attorneys representing the family of Nichols have said that an independent autopsy they commissioned found Nichols suffering ""extensive bleeding caused by a severe beating."" The full findings of the report were not made public. Four of the five former Memphis Police officers indicted for their role in the death of Nichols were suspended or received a written reprimand during their tenure, with only one charged officer avoiding internal disciplining during his tenure. Nichols, the father of a four-year-old son, was known to his family as an avid skateboarder and nature photographer from Sacramento, California, according to The Associated Press. He arrived in Memphis just before the pandemic and later started a job with FedEx, a major employer there. The New York Times reported that Nichols had been with the company for about nine months before his death.  ""Tyre Nichols: U.S. police violence stems from a long history of fighting 'internal enemies,'"" read a headline from U.S. news portal The Conversation. ""Next to other western democracies, America has historically had a far bigger proportion of racial and ethnic minorities,"" and few of those minorities have fit easily within the constitutionally recognized community of ""the people,"" said the report. ""White authorities were very clear as to the rationale"" that ""Black people were neither citizens (like white men) nor members of households (like white women and children),"" said the report. ""Rather, they were an 'internal enemy,' a hostile and alien element within the lawful community."" Blacks were regarded as existential threats to the lawful population. These sentiments fuelled violence by the U.S. National Guard, by hired thugs known as Pinkertons and by lynch mobs, noted the news portal. The most recent echo of the pattern is the so-called ""broken windows"" philosophy of policing that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s. The basic idea here is that fear of violent crime is itself cause for police intervention, it added.  Mourning the death of Nichols, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday expressed hope that Nichols' death might ""shine a light on the path toward peace and justice"" as she called on Congress to pass police reform legislation. Initially introduced in 2020 and again in 2021, the legislation is aimed at setting up a national registry of police misconduct to stop officers from evading consequences for their actions by moving to another jurisdiction. The bill twice cleared the House of Representatives under Democratic control, in 2020 and 2021, mainly along party lines. But it never went anywhere in the Senate, even after Democrats won control in 2021, ""in part, because of disagreements about qualified immunity, which protects police officers from being sued in civil court,"" CNN once reported. ""And the road for police reform has only become more challenging in the new Congress now that House Republicans, who have placed their priorities elsewhere, are in the majority,"" it added.",Xinhua,2023-02-03 13:47
452,The U.S. Willful Practice of Long-arm Jurisdiction and its Perils,"BEIJING, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Willful Practice of Long-arm Jurisdiction and its Perils February 2023  Introduction I. An Overview of U.S. Long-arm Jurisdiction II. Exercise and Expansion of U.S. Long-arm Jurisdiction III. The Perils of U.S. Long-arm Jurisdiction Conclusion  The United States has a longstanding practice of exerting frequent long-arm jurisdiction over other countries, including both its allies and countries with which it has hostile or strained relations. In recent years, the practice has kept expanding in scope, with U.S. ""arms"" stretching longer and longer. Examining cases of U.S. abuse of long-arm jurisdiction, this report lays bare the severe harm it has done to the international political and economic order and the international rule of law.  ◆According to U.S. domestic law, long-arm jurisdiction refers to jurisdiction over persons or entities domiciled or resident outside the territory of the sanctioning state. First established by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of International Shoe Co. v. State of Washington (1945), long-arm jurisdiction allows state courts to exercise in personam jurisdiction in civil and commercial cases where jurisdiction cannot be exercised because the defendant is not domiciled in the state, on the basis that the defendant has some ""minimum contacts"" with the state. ◆According to international law, the exercise of a country's jurisdiction over an extraterritorial person or entity generally requires that the person or entity or its conduct has a real and sufficient connection to that country. Yet the U.S. exercises long-arm jurisdiction on the basis of the ""minimum contacts"" rule, constantly lowering the threshold for application. Even the flimsiest connection with the United States, such as having a branch in the United States, using U.S. dollar for clearing or other financial services, or using the U.S. mail system, constitutes ""minimum contacts."" ◆To exercise long-arm jurisdiction, the United States has further developed the ""effects doctrine,"" meaning that jurisdiction may be exercised whenever an act occurring abroad produces ""effects"" in the United States, regardless of whether the actor has U.S. citizenship or residency, and regardless of whether the act complies with the law of the place where it occurred. The United States has also been expanding the scope of its long-arm jurisdiction to exert disproportionate and unwarranted jurisdiction over extraterritorial persons or entities, enforcing U.S. domestic laws on extraterritorial non-US persons or entities, and wantonly penalizing or threatening foreign companies by exploiting their reliance on dollar-denominated businesses, the U.S. market or U.S. technologies. ◆In essence, long-arm jurisdiction is an arbitrary judicial practice, wielded by the U.S. government on the strength of its national power and financial hegemony, to enforce extraterritorial jurisdiction over entities and individuals of other countries on the ground of its domestic law.  ◆In the many years of exercising such jurisdiction, the United States has gradually developed a massive, mutually reinforcing and interlocking legal system for long-arm jurisdiction, and continued to lower the threshold and expand its discretionary power, thus shaping long-arm jurisdiction into a tool for the United States to advance hegemonic diplomacy and pursue economic interests. Such practice disregards other countries' sovereignty, blatantly meddles in others' internal affairs, seriously damages the legitimate interests of other countries, and disrupts the normal order of international exchanges. The expansion of U.S. long-arm jurisdiction is all-dimensional. Citing the ""minimum contacts"" rule and the ""effects doctrine,"" the United States has developed massive and complex legal and enforcement systems to support its long-arm jurisdiction which is expanding in scope and fields of application. ◆ Long-arm jurisdiction has also become a means by which the United States abuses unilateral sanctions, especially secondary sanctions. To ensure the extraterritorial effects of U.S. sanction laws, the United States would usually exercise judicial authority to hold extraterritorial entities and individuals accountable for failing to comply with U.S. sanction laws. In addition to long-arm jurisdiction, administrative, economic, financial and other means would also be employed to implement its secondary sanctions. ◆Compulsory extraterritorial evidence collection is another important means of long-arm jurisdiction. In the judicial process involving other countries, the United States frequently takes unilateral compulsory measures to collect evidence outside its own territory, circumventing normal channels of judicial and law enforcement cooperation between countries. It would directly ask banks and Internet firms that have branches or are listed in the United States to provide evidence such as account information and data located outside the United States. When other countries try to raise démarche, the United States would always respond by citing excuses such as ""judicial independence"" or ""low efficiency in normal judicial assistance or law enforcement cooperation."" These typical examples of long-arm jurisdiction have severely damaged other countries' judicial sovereignty, and the legitimate rights and interests of those subjects of evidence collection. ◆The United States has put in place a whole-of-government system to practice long-arm jurisdiction, which features a division of labor among departments and inter-agency collaboration. The President and Congress are the main decision makers when it comes to sanctions. The President decides on most of the economic sanctions, and Congress participates through legislative activities under specific circumstances. At the heart of sanctions enforcement is the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), an agency under Treasury responsible for freezing assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction, formulating and adjusting lists of sanctioned individuals and entities, and reviewing and issuing licenses. The Department of State's Office of Economic Sanctions Policy and Implementation (SPI) is responsible for developing and implementing foreign policy-related sanctions. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), an agency of the Department of Commerce, administers separate lists from the OFAC. On top of these, the U.S. government bolsters its sanctions enforcement through control of SWIFT and CHIPS, two major cross-border payment and clearing systems, by pressing them, when it deems necessary, to cut off contact with the financial institutions of the subject country to achieve the purpose of economic sanctions. ◆The United States has stepped up legislation for long-arm jurisdiction. A wide range of laws in the United States advance long-arm jurisdiction, including Trading with the Enemy Act, International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and Helms-Burton Act. Others such as the USA PATRIOT Act and National Defense Authorization Act contain long-arm jurisdiction clauses. A number of presidential executive orders also involve long-arm jurisdiction. More and more U.S. federal legislation contains long-arm jurisdiction clauses to prevent Americans from circumventing U.S. laws by establishing subsidiaries in foreign countries, or foreigners enjoying less restrictions than Americans, or relevant international rules-making hurting U.S. interests. These legislative moves allow the United States to enforce long-arm jurisdiction in its diplomacy by citing domestic laws. ◆ There is a growing tendency of the U.S. applying long-arm jurisdiction to criminal cases, which is an extreme abuse of the practice. In recent years, a number of U.S. federal laws include extraterritorial clauses, which have been exploited by the Department of Justice to launch criminal investigations and prosecutions. In these proceedings, federal courts begin to apply the concept of long-arm jurisdiction when examining the basis of their jurisdiction by broadly interpreting the connection between the case and the United States, expanding the scope of personal and territorial jurisdiction, and lowering the threshold for the application of protective jurisdiction and general jurisdiction.  ◆The United States is the only sanctions superpower in the world. According to the Treasury 2021 Sanctions Review, by fiscal year 2021,the number of active U.S. sanctions designations had increased to more than 9,400. ◆Sanctions strain relations between countries and undermine the international order. Healthy state-to-state relations are the bedrock for peace and stability in the international order. In the 1990s, the United States introduced the Helms-Burton Act to impose economic sanctions through long-arm jurisdiction on individuals and entities worldwide conducting transactions with Cuba. It sparked strong opposition from the European Union, who in 1996 passed the Blocking Statute to neutralize through legislation the effects of U.S. long-arm jurisdiction within the EU, and enable individuals and entities in the EU to sue individuals and entities in the United States. Apart from this, the EU put forward a series of proposals and initiatives at the UN General Assembly, the Security Council, the World Trade Organization and other international bodies, calling on the international community to pay attention to the harmful effects of U.S. long-arm jurisdiction, and even resorted to the WTO dispute settlement procedures. So far, the ""long arm"" of U.S. jurisdiction has reached China, Russia, Iran, Syria, the DPRK, Cuba, France, the UK, Germany, Japan, among others. In an article published in Foreign Affairs, Professor Daniel Drezner of Tufts University criticized successive U.S. administrations for abusing economic coercion and economic violence and using sanctions as the preferred solution to diplomatic problems, which have been ineffective and causing humanitarian disasters. ◆Since 1979, the United States has imposed various types of unilateral sanctions on Iran and other countries. In 1996, it rolled out the D'Amato Act which forbids foreign companies from investing in the energy sector of Iran and Libya, resulting in long-term damaging ramifications. Afterward, the United States keeps ramping up sanctions against Iran. Under the Trump administration, it harbored a policy of ""maximum pressure"" and wanted to use sanctions to effect a regime change in Iran. According to then Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, sanctions under the Trump administration caused at least US$200 billion worth of economic damage to Iran; he condemned such sanctions as inhumane, a crime and an act of terrorism. ◆Between 1980 and 1992, the United States imposed unilateral sanctions on Libya, and from 1992 to 2003, it rallied or coerced allies into expanding sanctions against Libya. The World Bank noted that Libya suffered up to US$18 billion economic losses as a result of the sanctions, while an official Libyan estimate put the figure at 33 billion. ◆Crude U.S. sanctions on Iraq after the Gulf War brought about serious consequences. From August 1990 to May 2003, they caused a total loss of US$150 billion in Iraq's oil revenue. As a result, the country's per capita income falls below its 1990 level of US$7,050 even to this day. The sanctions have also caused a serious humanitarian disaster, with infant mortality rate doubling and the under-five mortality increasing six-fold. Meanwhile, Iraq's education, health and social security systems were destroyed; its literacy rate fell from 89 percent in 1987 to 57 percent in 1997. ◆Undermining the purposes and functions of various international governance mechanisms. The United States has frequently imposed unilateral sanctions outside the UN framework. In 2021 alone, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Department of Commerce and other agencies imposed various sanctions on as many as over 2,000 entities. As a result, the sanctioning function of the Security Council is undercut, seriously affecting its normal function of maintaining international peace and security. When the International Criminal Court (ICC) attempted to investigate suspected war crimes by U.S. forces in Afghanistan, the United States, with itself not being a member of the Court, responded by launching sanctions against ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and senior official Phakiso Mochochoko, sparking unanimous outcry from the international community. Despite the ruling of the Dispute Settlement Body of WTO that its Section 301 procedures are a violation of international law, the United States continues to launch various unilateral Section 301 investigations on imports from China and other countries, and keeps all existing Section 301 tariffs unchanged. Such actions have directly sabotaged the tariff concessions achieved by many rounds of difficult negotiations of the multilateral trading system, blatantly trampled on the purposes and spirit of the multilateral trading system, and eroded the cornerstone of the system's operation. ◆Undermining the interests of companies of other countries. To maintain its economic and technological supremacy, the United States abuses its public power to interfere with normal international commercial exchanges and competition. Under the pretext of safeguarding national security and fighting against human rights violations, it has adopted a package of measures including the Entity List and economic sanctions to restrict foreign enterprises from obtaining raw materials, items and technologies vital to their survival and development, sometimes even used secondary sanctions to cut those companies' normal trade with enterprises from other countries in an effort to disrupt their supply chains root and branch. ◆A case in point is the imprisonment of a senior manager from the French company Alstom. In 2013, in order to beat Alstom in their business competition, the United States applied the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to arrest and detain Frédéric Pierucci on charges of bribing foreign officials. He was further induced to sign a plea deal and provide more evidence and information against his company, leaving Alstom no choice but to accept General Electric's acquisition, vanishing ever since from the Fortune 500 list. The U.S. long-arm jurisdiction has become a tool for its public power to suppress competitors and meddle in normal international business activities, announcing the United States’ complete departure from its long-standing self-proclaimed champion of liberal market economy. ◆In recent years, the United States has frequently employed the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act (2016) to impose unilateral sanctions on entities in various countries deemed to have engaged in ""serious human rights violations."" However, while exercising such unilateral sanctions, the United States has often violated the basic human rights of the sanctioned subjects disregarding the fact that their human rights are also entitled to protection. ◆When COVID-19 was raging in the world, the U.S. government did not relent in imposing unilateral sanctions on Iran, Syria and other countries, making it difficult for these countries to obtain the much-needed medical supplies to fight the virus. As a result of the sanctions, Iran has been cut off access to essential medicines and medical equipment, putting the health of millions of Iranians in jeopardy. To raise funds to fight the pandemic, the Iranian government applied to the IMF for a US$5 billion dollar exclusive loan, but the effort was blocked by the United States. Even worse, the United States prevented Iran from importing COVID vaccines by freezing its overseas funds and threatening vaccine suppliers. As the Brookings Institution estimated, during the height of the pandemic in Iran, U.S. sanctions further exacerbated the spread of the virus and could have caused up to 13,000 of deaths.  The U.S. long-arm jurisdiction is not something new. In spite of adaptations over time in its contents and measures, the nature of the U.S. long-arm jurisdiction has not changed: it has been, since the very beginning, a hegemonic tool to maintain U.S. hegemony, suppress foreign competitors, interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and even subvert the governments of other countries. Over the last few years, the United States has abused long-arm jurisdiction by continuing to lower the threshold and intensifying measures to an unprecedented degree against wider range of targets. It not only undermines the principle of sovereign equality, violates international law, and erodes the multilateral order with the UN at its core, but also creates and intensifies tensions and conflicts among major countries, and poses a threat to the international security system established after World War II. It also interferes with and distorts normal international commercial exchanges and trade order, disrupts the supply chain of global trade, damages the interests of enterprises and raises their operating costs. The United States should renounce its illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction measures, and truly take up its international responsibilities as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.",Xinhua,2023-02-03 17:04
453,U.S. technological hegemony reveals foul imperialist mentality,"  BEIJING, Feb. 4 (Xinhua) -- The harsher export restrictions that the United States intends to impose on the Chinese tech firm Huawei reveal nothing but its zero-sum and foul imperialist mentality. Such vile moves would certainly disrupt global industrial and supply chains, causing harm to all parties involved. The U.S. administration has stopped providing U.S. companies with licenses to export to Huawei and is pushing a deal with Japan and the Netherlands for them to impose new restrictions on exports of chip-making tools to China, according to recent reports by international media outlets. This is yet another case of U.S. barefaced technological hegemony, as it has repeatedly resorted to the use of state power to suppress Huawei and other Chinese tech firms, citing so-called national security concerns. Despite failing to provide a shred of evidence to substantiate its concerns, the United States continues to impose such sanctions, demonstrating its irrational and insolent behavior and imperialistic mindset. It is not the first time the United States has suppressed a foreign company in this manner. The French company Alstom and the Japanese semiconductor industry fell prey to suppression by the United States through various means. To retain its technological edge over others, the United States turns to blatant hegemonic measures to restrict major industrial competitors, in violation of market economy and international trade rules. The world needs fair play rather than foul play, rules-based and win-win cooperation rather than unscrupulous oppression, and justice and equality rather than bullying and hegemony. Even some U.S. observers acknowledge the reprehensible nature of their country's policies. In a piece published online in the Economist on Jan. 12, William Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official, was quoted as saying: ""We have moved from a 'run faster' to a 'run faster and trip the other guy' policy."" The U.S. government's technological hegemony will inevitably cause damage to the global innovation ecosystem and dampen the innovation and growth of tech companies around the world. It risks depriving people of their right to enjoy the benefits of technological progress worldwide. In an era of globalization, the development of a country's sci-tech innovation depends on the global division of labor. Tech bullying by the United States flouts the rules and order of the international market. Such acts will only create uncertainty for businesses in their decision-making. America's technological hegemony will also damage the interests of its allies. In seeking to maintain its own hegemony, the United States has demanded that companies from other countries cooperate with its sanctions. The companies of these allies would face a significant loss in revenue from China, the largest semiconductor market in the world, if their governments blindly mimic the self-serving policy of the United States. Moreover, attempts to trip competitors up to maintain one's status may not bring the intended results but are more likely to backfire. For many American companies, Huawei is an important customer and China is an important market. These enterprises have been applying to the U.S. government for supply licenses for exports to China, signaling a desire to conduct business with Chinese companies. Many American companies have advanced their own innovation because they have Huawei as their partner. The profits they made from selling products to Huawei will also help strengthen their R&D capacity and boost their sci-tech progress. Thus, the sanctions of the U.S. government are detrimental to the interests of American enterprises. China will move faster toward self-reliance in science and technology so as to relieve the stranglehold some countries have tightened on China's development of core technologies. The attempts of the United States to hobble China's technological development will only accelerate the country's drive in the field. Anyone who attempts to obstruct the path of others will have their own path blocked. The U.S. technological hegemony will create division and disorder in international trade -- a serious impediment to the COVID-impacted world economy. Enterprises and governments around the world should act prudently and not succumb to the pressure and coercion of the United States. They should stand up to oppose its unreasonable trade actions, and safeguard international equity and justice, as well as their own interests.",Xinhua,2023-02-05 09:44

770,"EU, G7 impose price caps on Russian petroleum products","BRUSSELS - The European Union (EU), together with the Group of Seven (G7), adopted on Saturday further price caps for seaborne Russian petroleum products, according to a European Commission (EC) press release. The price cap for ""premium-to-crude"" petroleum products, such as diesel, kerosene and gasoline, is set at $100 per barrel, while the cap for ""discount-to-crude"" petroleum products, such as fuel oil and naphtha, is set at $45 per barrel, the EC has said. The price caps will be implemented from Sunday, the EC has said, adding that it includes ""a 55-day wind-down period"" for seaborne Russian petroleum products purchased above the price cap, provided it is loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading prior to Feb 5, 2023 and unloaded at the final port of destination prior to April 1, 2023. Meanwhile, the EU's ban in June 2022 on import of Russian petroleum products will also take effect on Sunday. In December 2022, the EU placed a price cap of $60 per barrel on Russian seaborne crude oil, which was joined by the G7. In December, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree banning supplies of Russian oil and petroleum products if contracts directly or indirectly provide for a price cap, Sputnik reported.",Xinhua,2023-02-05 10:52
772,Japan PM sacks top aide over anti-LGBT comments,"TOKYO, Feb. 4 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on Saturday that he has fired Masayoshi Arai as secretary to him over discriminatory remarks against sexual minorities. Kishida, who has recently expressed caution over legalizing same-sex marriage, told reporters that he took the issue ""very seriously"" and that Arai's successor has already been decided. ""Executive secretary Arai's remarks totally contradict the government's policy and are inexcusable,"" said the prime minister. Arai, an elite bureaucrat from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) who serves as an executive secretary to the prime minister, said during an off-the-record conversation with reporters the previous day that he would ""not want to live next door"" to an LGBT couple and that he would ""hate even to see them."" Arai also said that if same-sex marriage is introduced in Japan, it would ""change the way society is"" and that ""there are quite a few people who would abandon this country."" Arai quickly retracted the comments on Friday after they were made public by the media and apologized, adding that the remarks did not reflect Kishida's own thinking. Arai, 55-year-old, was appointed an executive secretary to the prime minister in October 2021, when the Kishida administration took office, from his post as director-general of the commerce and information policy bureau at the METI.",Xinhua,2023-02-05 10:58
427,NATO urges Russia to respect nuclear pact with U.S.,"BRUSSELS, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on Friday called on Russia to respect its treaty with the United States on nuclear weapons, which contributes to international stability. NATO ambassadors said in a statement that ""We note with concern that Russia has failed to comply with legally-binding obligations under the New START Treaty."" The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) was signed by Russia and the United States in 2010. The last remaining nuclear arms control treaty in force between the two nuclear superpowers can be extended by a maximum of five years with the consent of the two countries. Russia and the United States officially extended the treaty by five years on Feb. 3, 2021. The ambassadors said that Russia's refusal to hold consultations or to allow U.S. inspections since last August ""prevents the United States from exercising important rights under the treaty, and undermines the United States' ability to adequately verify Russian compliance with the treaty's central limits."" ""We call on Russia to fulfil its obligations under the treaty by facilitating New START inspections on Russian territory, and by returning to participation in the treaty's implementation body,"" NATO said. Earlier this week, Moscow accused the United States of undermining the principles of implementing the treaty. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said that Moscow remains committed to the treaty but does not see the same commitment from Washington.",Xinhua,2023-02-05 11:07
428,"U.S. stocks drop, oil prices fall as strong U.S. jobs report prompts rate concerns","NEW YORK, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- A stronger-than-expected U.S. employment situation report weighed on markets Friday, causing both the U.S. stocks and oil prices to end noticeably lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 127.93 points, or 0.38 percent, to 33,926.01. The S&P 500 sank 43.28 points, or 1.04 percent, to 4,136.48. The Nasdaq Composite Index shed 193.86 points, or 1.59 percent, to 12,006.95. All the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in red, with consumer discretionary and communication services down 3.11 percent and 2.22 percent, respectively, leading the slide. Sentiment on the oil market was also dented with both the U.S. and the global crude benchmarks falling to their multi-week lows. The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for March delivery dropped 2.49 U.S. dollars, or 3.28 percent, to settle at 73.39 dollars a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest finish since Jan. 4. Brent crude for April delivery lost 2.23 dollars, or 2.71 percent, to close at 79.94 dollars a barrel on the London ICE Futures Exchange. That was the lowest settlement since Jan. 9. The above market reactions came as a strong January U.S. jobs report prompted concerns over higher rates. U.S. employers added 517,000 jobs in January, crushing estimates, the Labor Department reported on Friday. The huge job growth was compounded by a new low in the unemployment rate, which fell from 3.5 percent to 3.4 percent, a new 54-year low. Neither the markets nor the Federal Reserve had anticipated such strong jobs data, Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial, said in a note on Friday. On the side of the Fed, ""a super-tight labor market is the most compelling reason to keep hiking rates,"" he said. The Fed on Wednesday raised interest rates by 25 basis points, boosting the target range for the federal funds rate to 4.5-4.75 percent, as it continued its fight against inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed recognizes that the pace of inflation has eased, but ""it would be very premature to declare victory."" Powell said that with the labor market still tight, he expects ""ongoing"" increases to get monetary policy ""sufficiently restrictive"" to engineer a more balanced job market and bring down too-high inflation. He referred to a ""couple more"" rate hikes, giving the impression that the cycle is drawing closer to the end. ""Markets are interpreting Wednesday's FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting in a dovish light,"" but ""the Fed's comments also contained plenty of more hawkish elements,"" UBS analysts said on Friday. The Fed remains concerned about the risk of doing too little, they noted, adding that ""we continue to believe that markets have moved too far and too fast in pricing a dovish pivot in Fed policy."" For the week, the Dow slipped nearly 0.2 percent, the S&P 500 gained 1.6 percent and the Nasdaq rose 3.3 percent. For oil, the WTI logged a weekly drop of 7.9 percent, while Brent declined 7.5 percent for the week, based on the front-month contracts.",Xinhua,2023-02-05 11:22

425,Global vaccine accessibility urged as Western countries ditch expired doses,"LONDON, Feb. 4 (Xinhua) -- As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose a threat to global public health, the World Health Organization (WHO) last month calls for the momentum for vaccination to be maintained to better cover high-priority groups. The vaccine uptake in low- and middle-income countries is still insufficient, which became a concern about the ongoing risk, according to the WHO. The world has been struggling to tackle the problem of unequal distribution of COVID-19 vaccines between rich and lower-income countries. Yet, years after the outbreak of the pandemic, promises made by many rich countries have yet to be delivered. ""No one is safe until everyone is safe,"" said Seth Berkley, CEO of the global vaccine alliance Gavi.  According to figures from Our World in Data, as early as two years ago, developed countries had already acquired enough doses to vaccinate their population more than one shot for each. But even now, many Western developed countries have not yet fulfilled their promises to deliver vaccines to low-income countries. There are currently nearly 400 million doses of vaccines announced by the United States but not yet donated, according to the data. For the United Kingdom and Switzerland, the number is 41 million and 6.2 million. Commenting on the low vaccination rates in low-income countries, Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, told Xinhua in an earlier interview that ""the delay in vaccines getting to them has really been intolerable."" Last month at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2023 in Davos, Switzerland, Hatchett urged countries and manufacturers to prioritize vaccine supply to the global program COVAX.  According to a report by qz.com last October, Canada destroyed nearly 14 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses in early 2022. Switzerland was also reported to destroy more than 14 million doses of vaccines, which was more than four times the doses it donated to low-income countries. What also worsened the global accessibility of vaccines is that some low-income countries had to turn down the offering of vaccine doses that were due to expire soon, or had to destroy such doses. In May 2021, Malawi destroyed nearly 20,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines, which arrived in the country at the end of March but would expire on April 13. In an article published in the Sunday Mirror newspaper in 2021, WHO Ambassador for Global Health Financing Gordon Brown said the West's stockpile of COVID-19 vaccine is growing by the day but many poorer parts of the world are missing out. ""We must act now,"" said the former British prime minister.  The obvious gap between immunity in rich and poorer countries has drawn the attention of many experts. Many have warned that the longer the unequal vaccine distribution exists, the wider COVID-19 spreads, and new variants are more likely to emerge. Extremely unequal vaccine distribution has typified the availability of vaccines across countries, said a study published in August 2022 in the UK journal Communications Medicine. ""In an unequal world with open economies, pandemics do not stop at national borders,"" it stressed. Since about 85 percent of the global population resides in low- and middle-income countries, most of humanity remains exposed to continued outbreaks, the study said, adding that this situation increases the risk that further virus variants will emerge, possibly undermining the efficacy of existing vaccines. Most people in the world's poorest countries might not have access to COVID-19 vaccines until at least mid-2023, it said. ""We will only prevent variants from emerging if we are able to protect all of the world's population, not just the wealthy parts,"" said Berkley. As long as large portions of the world's population are unvaccinated, variants will continue to appear, and the pandemic will continue to be prolonged, he said.",Xinhua,2023-02-05 13:39
430,U.S. announces additional security assistance for Ukraine worth over 2 bln USD,"  WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden announced Friday an additional round of security assistance for Ukraine with a total value of 2.2 billion U.S. dollars. The latest package was divided into two parts - 425 million dollars through the Presidential Drawdown Authority, and 1.75 billion dollars from the congressionally-approved Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, according to a statement from the Defense Department. What's particularly noticeable in the materiel are long-range rockets for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS missile launchers that the United States have provided for Ukraine. The new rockets are GPS-guided Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bombs (GLSDB) with a range of roughly 90 miles, more than doubling the 40-mile range that previous U.S.-provided HIMARS-compatible missiles have. The GLSDB's range, however, falls short compared to that of the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), which has long been sought by Ukraine but refused by the United States for fear of escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The ATACMS has a range of nearly 200 miles. The U.S. government will contract with weapons manufacturers to provide the GLSDB, as well as two HAWK air defense firing units and unspecified ""equipment to integrate Western air defense launchers, missiles, and radars with Ukraine's air defense systems."" That means it will be months away from the actual delivery of these weapons. The United Sates has committed more than 29.3 billion dollars in security assistance for Ukraine since the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out nearly a year ago, according to the Pentagon's statement.",Xinhua,2023-02-05 13:41
429,West implements price caps on Russian oil products as Moscow vows to safeguard interests,"BEIJING, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- The implementation of further price caps for seaborne Russian petroleum products, adopted Saturday by the European Union (EU) and the Group of Seven, began Sunday, despite Russia's vow to take measures to protect its interests. The price cap for ""premium-to-crude"" petroleum products, such as diesel, kerosene and gasoline, is set at 100 U.S. dollars per barrel, while the cap for ""discount-to-crude"" petroleum products, such as fuel oil and naphtha, is set at 45 dollars per barrel, the European Commission said in a press release. It includes ""a 55-day wind-down period"" for seaborne Russian petroleum products purchased above the price cap, provided it is loaded onto a vessel at the loading port before Feb. 5, 2023, and unloaded at the final port of destination before April 1, 2023, the commission added. Meanwhile, the EU's ban in June 2022 on imports of Russian petroleum products also took effect Sunday. The Kremlin warned Friday of a ""further imbalance"" in global energy markets. ""Naturally this will lead to a further imbalance of the international energy markets, but we are taking measures to hedge our interests against the risks associated,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. In December 2022, the EU placed a price cap of 60 U.S. dollars per barrel on Russian seaborne crude oil, a move adopted by the Group of Seven. Under the price cap, insurance, finance and other services for Russian oil shipments will be banned if oil sells for more than 60 U.S. dollars a barrel. In response, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Dec. 27, 2022, announcing countermeasures to the price ceiling on Russian oil. According to the decree, the supply of Russian oil and petroleum products to foreign legal entities and individuals will be banned if a price cap is directly or indirectly stipulated in the contracts. The Russian president could grant special permission to deliver oil and petroleum products otherwise prohibited under the decree.",Xinhua,2023-02-05 15:09

435,Guilty of innocence: Western smear campaign against China exposed,"BEIJING, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- ""The mainstream media and quite a number of politicians and governments intimidate us daily that China's rise poses a threat to the rest of the world and especially to the West,"" said veteran Spanish journalist Javier Garcia in his new book ""China, Threat or Hope. The Reality of a Pragmatic Revolution."" ""China is not a threat at all,"" Garcia said in an interview with Xinhua, noting that the country has become the second world economic power ""without practically firing a single shot, without violence, without wars, without colonialism.""  For the former delegate of EFE, the leading news agency in Spanish, in the Middle East, Venezuela, Germany and China, the supposed ""China Threat"" theory is nothing more than a systematized U.S. trick to contain the peaceful rise of the Asian country, which for Washington means a great challenge to its hegemony. ""The U.S. refuses to accept that its days to maintain the world hegemonic dominance are numbered,"" Garcia said in the book, which was published by Ediciones Akal. Washington, he said, has launched a ""hybrid war"" like ""an octopus with multiple tentacles"" in the economic, commercial, technological, scientific, political, health and media sectors, combined with intelligence and espionage operations, destabilization campaigns in regions such as Xinjiang, support for separatism in Hong Kong or Taiwan, and military intimidation along China's coast. Among the multiple battlefronts, Garcia said he is very familiar with the smear campaign against China orchestrated by the Western media that ""set the agenda and the tone about China"" so that the rest of the Western press follows them ""mostly without reservations."" In his work, Garcia listed the ""arsenal of words"" aimed at instilling fear in anything related to China and reinforcing the negative image installed in the heads of readers, manipulating the terms like ""regime,"" ""purge,"" ""propaganda"" and ""repression"" or expressions like ""power struggles,"" ""under threat"" and ""debt trap.""   In this sense, the rich in the United States are millionaires or great entrepreneurs, while those in China are oligarchs; China does not fire corrupt or inefficient officials, but rather ""purges"" them; China does not grant advantageous loans to develop infrastructure in poor countries, but ""traps"" them in debt; China adopts ""vaccine diplomacy,"" and other countries donate them selflessly; China ""monitors and controls"" close contacts of COVID cases, and other countries trace them. According to Garcia, the Western media have even created a universal rhetoric of ""at what cost,"" in order to seek in any case the negative consequence of positive news about China, such as ""the Chinese economy grows, but at what cost""; ""Chinese cities are getting smart, but at what cost""; ""China provides abundant snow for the Olympic Games, but at what cost""; ""clean air, at what cost?""; ""Wuhan is safe from Covid, but at what cost""; ""China invests in Ethiopia, but at what cost""; ""China boosts Cambodia's economy, but at what cost""; etc. One of the most ""curious"" examples is that Bloomberg reported in December 2019 that ""China cures cancer faster and cheaper than anyone else, but some worry it's too fast."" Garcia explained that the U.S. media is those who set the tone, and it is really very difficult for other Western media to get out of that way, since they are very much influenced by the former.  The journalist took advantage of his stay of more than four years in China to observe the country closely. With an independent approach, he has found an authentic China which is totally different from the one described by the Western media. ""The truth is that China surprised me. It is a very different country, very diverse, very developed in certain things. It is a fascinating country and has many things that one does not expect what life is like in the country,"" said the writer. ""I tried to arrive in the country freeing myself from all prejudices and with the most open mind possible."" While working as a reporter, Garcia met Ding Yan, 34 years old, who told him how her life had changed, from her childhood years in the countryside without running water or electricity, to studying at the university, receiving a degree in philology and settling into a city with access to top-quality public services.   ""When you start talking to people, you realize the changes in China. The change that this generation has experienced in the last 20 or 30 years is impressive,"" he said. Ordinary citizens brimming with joy and placidity deeply moved the then EFE delegate in Beijing, who felt, at the same time, tired of the incessant disinformation of the Western media against China. As a result, Garcia decided in September 2021 to quit journalism after more than 30 years in the profession, because ""the embarrassing information war against China has taken away a good dose of my enthusiasm for this profession."" For Garcia, the much-touted Western totem of ""free press"" boils down to ""saying exactly the same thing,"" ""sticking to the script,"" and ""emphasizing over and over again how bad communism is,"" since anyone who steps off the path set by the U.S. State Department and the U.S. media ""will be sidelined."" After submitting his resignation, Garcia began to write a book about an authentic China, because, in his opinion, ""many things about China are not known, and some key issues, which are very important to the world, are also not known because the readers are not informed.""  The author traveled to various regions, provinces and cities in China, such as Xinjiang and Shenzhen, to see firsthand the topics he was curious about. Regarding the alleged genocides in Xinjiang, Garcia said such accusations are solely based on data collected from the Internet and ""not based on any real situation or field work."" ""In Xinjiang, the Uygur culture is respected. The Uygur language is taught in schools and used in local media. The Uygur population has grown by 16 percent in the last ten years, which is three times more than the national population growth,"" he said. When asked about Chinese measures against COVID-19, Garcia said that ""there have not been human rights violations at all"" and that the recent optimization of its COVID response has come at a time when the virus is less aggressive and the danger of death is significantly reduced. ""If we consider that the priority of any government should be to save the lives of its population, of its inhabitants, Chinese policy has clearly been effective. There have been far fewer deaths in China than in Western countries and, above all, than in the United States,"" he said. With regard to the fight against poverty, the author believed that it is the main concern of all citizens of the world. Official data showed China has lifted some 770 million rural residents out of poverty during the past 40 years, accounting for over 70 percent of global poverty reduction.   On the ecological issue, Garcia was aware that the world has ""the image of China as a very polluting country,"" however, in his investigation he concluded that ""it is just the opposite."" ""China has totally changed its economic development model, it has gone from a development model focused on growth above all else, regardless of the consequences, to a much greener one, to one that has a lot of consideration for the environment,"" he said. He said that China ""is undergoing an energy transformation and has become a leader in renewable energy, electric mobility, electric cars, reforestation, with sponge city projects as an example."" Garcia attributed the admirable achievements to the ""pragmatic revolution"" led by the Communist Party of China (CPC) and described the way of doing politics as very ""characteristic of the Chinese style."" ""The CPC experiments with different solutions for any problem that arises, launches pilot projects in different cities on measures that it wants to apply, and experiments with them. Those that work best will be adopted and those that do not go well are rejected,"" Garcia explained. In Garcia's opinion, China is not a threat, but rather the hope for a multipolar world in which everyone can live much more peacefully, trading with the rest of the globe, dedicating their energies and resources to improving the lives of their population instead of to the enrichment of a few, and exchanging goods, knowledge and culture, instead of weapons and bombs. ""China has no intention of imposing its vision on others"" and stands ready to live with all nations in a multipolar world, a more peaceful,more just and better world, Garcia said.",Xinhua,2023-02-06 08:11
436,UN condemns deadly clashes in South Sudan after killing of 27,"JUBA, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) on Sunday condemned deadly violence in Kajo-Keji County in South Sudan's Central Equatoria State that left at least 27 dead and several others injured on Feb. 2. Nicholas Haysom, the UN secretary-general's special representative in South Sudan, called on the authorities to urgently launch an investigation and hold perpetrators to account. ""This violence is unacceptable and was in sharp contrast to the message of the Ecumenical Peace Pilgrimage to South Sudan, which called for peace and reconciliation,"" Haysom said in a statement issued in Juba, the capital of South Sudan. He said at least 2,000 people, mainly women and children, have become internally displaced, including 30 unaccompanied children. The UN expressed concern about the resurgence of killings and violence stemming from long-standing tensions between cattle-keepers and host communities in Central Equatoria State and in other parts of the country. Over the past two weeks, the UNMISS said, escalating violence has resulted in at least 45 deaths among unarmed civilians in Kajo-Keji and Mangalla Payam, among other areas in Central Equatoria. Haysom urged South Sudanese leaders to encourage restraint and avoid fueling any conflict, noting that the UNMISS is increasing patrols to the affected areas, and engaging the authorities as well as community leaders, to end these hostilities and seek peaceful solutions. The UNMISS said it welcomes the government's deployment of troops to the area to ease tensions and protect internally displaced persons.",Xinhua,2023-02-06 08:32
434,Cyprus' presidential election heads for runoff,"  NICOSIA, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- Former Cypriot foreign minister Nicos Christodoulides took the lead in Cyprus' presidential election on Sunday, and will face off with Andreas Mavroyiannis, who came second, in a runoff on Feb. 12. Christodoulides, who ran as an independent, garnered 32.04 percent of the vote, and Mavroyiannis, who also ran as an independent and supported by the left wing AKEL party, garnered 29.61 percent of the vote, Chief Returning Officer Costas Constantinou announced after the counting of all votes on Sunday. Fourteen candidates participated in the election, but none of them won an absolute majority. Averof Neophytou, leader of the ruling DISY party, ended third with 26.11 percent of the vote and was thus left out of the presidential race, ending the party's ten-year-long hold on power in the eastern Mediterranean island. Neophytou's performance in the election was considered by political analysts as a blow not only to himself but also to his right-wing party. Both Christodoulides and Mavroyiannis had been close associates of the outgoing president Nicos Anastasiades who will step down at the end of February. Christodoulides served for four years as spokesman for Anastasiades and then as his foreign minister for another four years. Mavroyiannis, a diplomat at the foreign ministry, had been Anastasiades' negotiator in peace talks with Turkish Cypriots for a settlement to the Cyprus problem. Political analysts said that the two presidential hopefuls would start wooing DISY voters for their support ahead of the runoff vote. A DISY official said the party would meet on Monday to decide its official stance in relation to the runoff. The Chief Returning Officer said that out of 561,273 registered voters 404,403 people, or 72.05 percent, cast ballot papers.",Xinhua,2023-02-06 08:34

The National Bank of Ethiopia will send 5 billion birrs to Mekele starting Monday, the state-affiliated Fana Broadcasting Corporate on Saturday quoted Redwan Hussein, National Security Advisor to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, as saying. Ahmed on Friday met with leaders of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) for the first time since the two-year conflict ended late last year with a peace deal.

""During the meeting, I stressed the need to adopt the best standards of transparency and good governance to ensure a fair distribution of Libyan wealth where all Libyans equally benefit from it,"" Bathily said. Libya failed to hold general elections in December 2021 as previously scheduled due to disagreements over election laws among the Libyan parties. Earlier in January, Dbeibah said his government is ready to hold general elections in the year 2023.

768,Deadly weekend shootings reflect again persistent gun violence in U.S.,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- Multiple deaths were reported in several fatal shootings across the United States over the weekend, revealing again the insurmountable problem of gun violence in the country. A 19-year-old woman was killed and four others injured in a shooting at a concert in Newport, Arkansas on Saturday night, local media reported, citing police sources. One of the wounded was taken to hospital for further treatment and two people have been arrested, with more arrests expected, said the report, adding that an investigation is underway. Another 41-year-old victim was lethally shot while sitting in his vehicle in the Lawndale neighborhood of Chicago Saturday morning, local police said. The man, who succumbed to his injuries after he was sent to a local hospital, was attacked by a gunman in a silver sedan who fled the scene on Lexington Street, according to the police. Another shooting took place at the DeSoto County Fair in a rural part of Florida on Saturday, killing a teenage boy, local authorities said. The shooting was identified as an isolated incident and the police have failed to catch the gunman by midday Sunday, they added. The murderous weekend again raised the escalating issue of gun violence in the United States to public concern, sparking an outcry for stricter gun controls. The United States has reported over 3,500 deaths from gun violence since the start of this year with more than 50 mass shootings recorded, according to Gun Violence Archive, a website that tracks gun violence in the country. ""We have the highest rates of gun deaths in the world. We have more guns than people ... We have more than one gun for every man, woman and child in America. That is insanity,"" Paul Cole Padilla, an educational administrator, told Xinhua. ""The trend (of gun violence) is going to get worse,"" said Stephen Ndegwa, a lecturer on international relations at the Nairobi-based United States International University-Africa. The expert warned that 2023 could be ""the worst year"" of gun violence in the history of the United States if the trend continues. Cihat Yayci, a retired Turkish admiral, said the high rate of individual armament ownership, resulting from the powerful gun lobbies in the United States, is one of the main reasons for the increasing shootings in the country. Both Republicans and Democrats are funded by gun rights advocacy groups, which have been conducting intense propaganda among ordinary people, said Yayci. Late last month, U.S. President Joe Biden released a statement, calling for tightened restrictions on gun purchase. According to Biden, a federal Assault Weapons Ban and legislation were reintroduced to raise the minimum purchase age for assault weapons to 21 after the mass shootings. ""I once again urge both chambers of Congress to act quickly and deliver this Assault Weapons Ban to my desk, and take action to keep American communities, schools, workplaces, and homes safe,"" he noted.",Xinhua,2023-02-06 14:49

It was followed by a magnitude-6.4 quake a few minutes later in the country's southern province of Gaziantep and a magnitude-7.6 earthquake at 1:24 p.m. local time (1024 GMT) in the Kahramanmaras Province. Residents ran out of their homes in their pajamas and t-shirts after the ground shook early Monday and have been waiting on the streets covered with ice and snow through the day.   Türkiye's southern province of Hatay bordering Syria suffered the most loss of life in the earthquake with at least 520 casualties. Two hospital buildings in the Hatay province collapsed, Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said. Rescue teams from the Turkish Red Crescent and AFAD were dispatched to the earthquake zone, while the Turkish security forces, search and rescue volunteers, and the rescue teams of several local administrations also participated in the efforts. The Turkish Defense Ministry has set up an air corridor to facilitate search and rescue teams to reach the quake-affected zone. Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said 3,500 soldiers participate in rescue operations. He noted that 17 aircraft are flying to the region from Istanbul, Izmir, and Ankara, carrying aid supplies. AFAD President Yunus Sezer said nearly 15,000 rescue personnel and about 5,000 vehicles and construction equipment had been deployed in the region.   The search and rescue efforts are being hampered by a winter blizzard as the temperatures recorded below 10 degrees celsius in most of the affected provinces. The weather service was forecasted rain and sleet across southeastern Türkiye until Thursday. Türkiye issued a level-4 alarm after the earthquake, which includes a call for international aid. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Ankara received offers for help from some 45 countries in the aftermath of the quake. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said members of the alliance were mobilizing support for Türkiye. More than 20 countries have sent rescue teams and assistance to help rescue efforts of Türkiye. An explosion occurred on a gas pipeline in Türkiye's southern province of Hatay and natural gas flow to southern Gaziantep, Hatay and Kahramanmaras provinces was suspended as a precaution. At the port of Iskenderun district in southern Hatay province, a fire broke out following the earthquake and emergency services intervened in the blaze.   In southern Gaziantep, walls and watch towers of an ancient castle, constructed as an observation point by the Hittite Empire, have been leveled, while other parts are largely destroyed by the earthquake. Türkiye declared national mourning for a week, with the flags to be flown half-mast. The Turkish education ministry has announced that schools across the country will be closed for seven days until Feb. 13. ""Due to the earthquakes that took place in our country on Feb. 6, a national mourning period was declared for seven days,"" said President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. ""Turkish flag will be hoisted at half-mast until sunset on Sunday all around Türkiye, at all foreign representations."" The country has often faced earthquakes due to its location at the crossroads of three different tectonic plates in Anatolia. Monday's earthquake is believed to be the strongest in Türkiye since the magnitude 7.9 eastern Erzincan province quake of 1939, which killed 33,000 people. In 1999, a 7.4-magnitude quake hit northwestern Izmit province, around 90 km east of Istanbul, killing at least 17,500 people, including 1,000 living in Istanbul. The Turkish authorities have introduced tighter building regulations, revised urban planning, and improved key public infrastructure amid a public awareness campaign following the 1999 quake.",Xinhua,2023-02-07 08:14

410,"Abused, erased, but forgotten no more","    Overlooking San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge and surrounding an art museum, the scenic Lincoln Park in a now wealthy and privileged neighborhood was once a burial ground for thousands of Chinese immigrants who helped build the city more than 100 years ago. To this day, the remains of hundreds of bodies still rest beneath the green turf of the Lincoln Park Golf Course, with many residents and golfers unaware of their presence. A weather-beaten funerary monument, near the first hole of the golf course, is the last standing structure that hints at the past of the park as a graveyard. The Chinese inscription on the structure, covered with patches of lichens and faded paint, indicates ""a temporary resting place for sojourners from Guangzhou"". The early Chinese immigrants originally wanted to be buried in their hometowns because it's the Chinese tradition that no matter how far they travel, their bodies should return to their homes. However, their wishes were never fulfilled as the burial ground, known as City Cemetery, was transformed into a public park and golf course in the early 20th century. Thanks to some local historians and Chinese communities, the cemetery has recently been designated as the city's first archaeological landmark. The monument also has been marked as ""Kong Chow Sojourners Tombs"" (Kong Chow means Guangzhou) in Google Maps. Two users have left five-star reviews for the location and posted photos. Yellow chrysanthemums, symbolizing grief in Chinese culture, and burning incense were seen in front of the ""Kong Chow"" shrine, a tradition to pay tribute to the deceased. ""I'm a frequent visitor to the Legion of Honor Museum, but I had never known here is the resting place for my ancestors until recently,"" said Yuyan Li, a first-generation immigrant from Guangdong province who lives not far from the park.    ""I feel so sad that they couldn't return to their roots and are permanently rested here. And I feel even sadder when I learned they were discriminated against when they were alive and erased from the history after they died,"" the graphic designer told China Daily. City Cemetery was a large burial ground for marginalized groups who couldn't pay for burials. It's estimated that more than 10,000 Chinese residents were buried in the cemetery during its operation from 1870 until 1898. The Chinese took up half of all burials, making it the largest and most significant burial ground for San Francisco's Chinese communities. After the site was reclassified as a municipal park in 1909, users of the cemetery were given six months to disinter the remains of their buried dead. It is not clear how many were removed because no records have survived. But historians estimate that at least 10,000 are still buried at Lincoln Park, many of them Chinese. The forgotten history of City Cemetery reflects the mistreatment of Chinese immigrants who helped build the city but were often excluded from the narratives of the city's history. Chinese laborers first arrived in San Francisco in the 1850s during the Gold Rush era, and immediately faced racism and discrimination in every aspect of their lives, including employment, housing, education and culture. Many of the discriminatory policies at that time sought to undermine the progress of Chinese immigrants by banning them from schools and the levers of power. For example, an 1860 policy prohibited Chinese students from attending public schools with white students, and an 1870 law barred anyone of Chinese descent from employment in any government work. The city also passed more than a dozen ordinances from 1873 to 1883 cracking down on Chinese laundries, leading to the infamous riots of 1877, which left four people dead and 20 laundry houses destroyed. Last year, San Francisco formally apologized to Chinese immigrants and their descendants for past atrocities amid a national trend of recognizing the history and contributions of Asian Americans. The Chinese community and San Francisco Heritage, a nonprofit organization, initiated efforts to preserve the history of City Cemetery about two years ago during rising anti-Asian hate and violence across the country. San Francisco Supervisor Connie Chan, a first-generation Chinese immigrant, introduced a resolution to designate the site as a historic landmark in April 2021. Mayor London Breed signed it into law in October 2022 after it was unanimously passed by the board of supervisors. Chan said she hoped the landmark designation would help people remember ""the blood and tears our Chinese immigrants shed as part of the power that has built San Francisco into the great city it is today"".    Woody LaBounty, interim president and CEO of San Francisco Heritage, said this site is ""a sacred space that deserves to be commemorated"" and a landmark designation would be an important first step. With the historic landmark status, the activists said the site could be better preserved with more attention and potential funding. For marginalized groups, landmarking a forgotten place such as the ""Kong Chow"" monument and City Cemetery is a restorative act of social justice, they said. Facing opposition from some golfers who were concerned that the landmarking would interfere with the maintenance of their playing grounds, the activists received support from Allison Vanderslice, principal environmental planner for the city. The site captures the cultural diversity of early San Francisco and is ""significant for its ability to add to our understanding of history and also its cultural associations and its funerary structures"", she said. Since 2021, the Chinese community has held ceremonies for Chongyang Festival (Double Ninth Festival), and Qingming Festival (Tomb Sweeping Day), when the Chinese pay their respects to the elderly and the deceased, respectively, at the Kong Chow monument. They were the first such ceremonies in decades. Chan hopes that Chinese Americans and community organizations will return to the monument each year to celebrate such traditional festivals. Li, the graphic designer, said she planned to attend the next ceremony, which usually includes prayers, the burning of incense and the offering of food. ""It would be a personal moment for me to honor my ancestors' struggle and sacrifice in this land,"" she said.",China Daily,2023-02-07 08:35

""My heart goes out to the people of Türkiye and Syria in this hour of tragedy,"" said the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in a statement. ""The United Nations is fully committed to supporting the response. Our teams are on the ground assessing the needs and providing assistance."" The initial 7.8 magnitude quake struck close to Gaziantep, a major city and capital of the Gaziantep Province, in the westernmost part of Türkiye's Southeastern Anatolia Region, followed by another 7.5 magnitude tremor several hours later. After the second earthquake, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) released a situation overview saying that ""close to 2,000 deaths have been reported"" in the two countries impacted, with at least 78 aftershocks. A Level 4 alarm has been issued by the Turkish government, requesting international assistance. In northwest Syria, 4.1 million people rely on humanitarian assistance, mostly women and children. A cholera outbreak is ongoing in Syrian communities, coupled with harsh winter weather. In the last quarter of 2022, there is a funding gap of 48 percent, with 371 million U.S. dollars pledged out of a required total of just over 800 million.   ""As part of the United Nations family, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) stands ready to support affected people in the coming days, weeks and months as they recover from this tragedy,"" UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said in a statement. The World Health Organization (WHO) has authorized emergency medical teams to provide care to the injured and most vulnerable populations, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a tweet. The OCHA noted that the epicenter of the initial 7.8 magnitude earthquake is close to Gaziantep in southern Türkiye, an important UN aid hub for northern Syria. Many cities in the region were affected. ""This is one of the largest earthquakes in recent times. Türkiye and Syria need all the help they can get. The current search and rescue efforts will last a few days but soon the main priority will be medical assistance for the injured, the restoration of water, power and other services, and shelter for those who have lost their homes,"" said former UN relief chief Mark Lowcock in a live commentary obtained by Xinhua through email. Lowcock is a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, a nonprofit think tank based in Washington, D.C., and London, which focuses on international development. ""Deeply saddened by the loss of life caused by this morning's #earthquake,"" the UN refugee agency in Syria tweeted, adding that it was ""actively coordinating a response with #UN Agencies and other humanitarian actors to deliver assistance and support to those in need in Syria.""   In northern Syria's Aleppo and Idlib, thousands of buildings, including two hospitals, collapsed during the earthquake, which was felt as far away as Lebanon. Millions of Syrians have been displaced by the long-running war in northern Syria, which poses huge humanitarian needs. Rescue teams have been hindered by snow and rain, and many of their families are believed to be buried under collapsed buildings. In response to an official request for international assistance from Ankara, the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) confirmed it was willing to assist. ""Our hearts and thoughts are with the children and families in Türkiye and Syria affected by the devastating earthquakes. Our deepest condolences to those who lost loved ones,"" said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.

422,Food prices surge dramatically in Sweden in January,"  STOCKHOLM, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- Inflation continues to hover at lofty levels in Sweden with food prices registering the largest monthly increases in a year, according to a report released here on Monday. In a survey covering around 44,000 items, price comparison site Matpriskollen found that food prices increased by 1.3 percent in January, which is one of the largest monthly increases since inflation took off sharply in January 2022, Swedish Television (SVT) reported. The prices of snacks and sweets increased by 3.1 percent month-on-month in January and by 14.8 percent year-on-year, followed by fish and seafood 2.4 percent (20.2 percent year-on-year), desserts 2.3 percent (17.2 percent), vegetables 1.9 percent (13.5 percent) and bread and cookies 1.9 percent (16.3 percent), SVT reported. Although the price hikes for cheese and dairy products were not as steep in January as for some other categories, cheese became 25.4 percent more expensive year-on-year, while the price of dairy products increased by 23.6 percent. Matpriskollen's survey also found that some items for which inflation was relatively modest in 2022 suddenly became considerably more expensive in January. ""For some items, the price hike was brutal in January,"" Ulf Mazur, founder and managing director of Matpriskollen, told SVT. ""This concerns, for example, sugar and beer. The remarkable thing is that it was not a long and slow increase but a shock increase (in January) for certain items,"" Mazur told SVT. As an example, SVT listed a brand of sugar in a particular size of packaging that was 44 percent more expensive in January. There are also examples where tomato juice and gluten-free pasta became 40 percent and 33 percent more expensive, respectively, SVT reported.

Negotiations will continue between the two sides within technical frameworks, Kanaani said. Iran signed the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), with world powers in July 2015, agreeing to put some curbs on its nuclear program in return for the removal of the sanctions on the country. The United States, however, pulled out of the deal in May 2018 and reimposed its unilateral sanctions on Iran, prompting the latter to reduce some of its nuclear commitments under the deal.

421,U.S. spends most on health care but has worst health outcomes: report,"   NEW YORK, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States spends more on health care than any other high-income country but still has the lowest life expectancy at birth and the highest rate of people with multiple chronic diseases, CNN reported. A report from The Commonwealth Fund, an independent research group, as quoted by CNN last week, said that compared with peer nations, the United States has the highest rates of deaths from avoidable or treatable causes and the highest maternal and infant death rates. ""Americans are living shorter, less healthy lives because our health system is not working as well as it could be,"" the report's lead author, Munira Gunja, senior researcher for The Commonwealth Fund's International Program in Health Policy and Practice Innovation, said in a news release. ""To catch up with other high-income countries, the administration and Congress would have to expand access to health care, act aggressively to control costs, and invest in health equity and social services we know can lead to a healthier population,"" Gunja was quoted as saying. People in the United States see doctors less often than those in most other countries, and the United States is the only country among those studied that doesn't have universal health coverage, according to the report. In 2021 alone, 8.6 percent of the U.S. population was uninsured.",Xinhua,2023-02-07 10:09

In the study published last week by the American Journal of Psychiatry, researchers found that increased stressors like economic hardship and systemic racism play a significant role for Black children and can lead to the development of mental health issues as they age. The stressors contribute to Black children having less gray matter in their brains, a byproduct of absorbing ""toxic stress."" The study defines the stressors as ""prolonged exposure to adverse experiences"" that lead to excessive stress hormones and ""disrupt the immune and metabolic regulatory systems."" Researchers at Harvard University examined MRI scans of 7,350 White and 1,786 Black children ages 9 and 10.

423,U.S. doctors demoralized by nation's health system: article,"NEW YORK, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- American physicians are now increasingly suffering from demoralization, which is not a reaction to a medical condition, but rather to the diseased systems they work for, said an article published on The New York Times website on Sunday. The United States is the only large high-income nation that doesn't provide universal healthcare to its citizens. Instead, it maintains a lucrative system of for-profit medicine, said the opinion piece, authored by Eric Reinhart, a political anthropologist and physician at Northwestern University. ""For decades, at least tens of thousands of preventable deaths have occurred each year because health care here is so expensive,"" it noted. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the consequences of this policy choice have intensified. One study estimates at least 338,000 COVID deaths in the United States could have been prevented by universal health care, it said. In the wake of this generational catastrophe, many health care workers have been left shaken, said the article. ""For me, doctoring in a broken place required a sustaining belief that the place would become less broken as a result of my efforts,"" but ""I couldn't sustain that belief any longer,"" Dr. Rachael Bedard was cited as saying about her decision to quit her job at New York City's Rikers Island prison complex during the pandemic.",Xinhua,2023-02-07 10:32

778,California gun laws cannot stop mass shootings without federal support: The Guardian,"LONDON, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- The recent mass shootings in Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay in California showed that state gun laws alone cannot stop mass shootings without coordinated U.S. federal response, The Guardian said in an analysis. California's gun laws include bans on the military-style assault weapons and large-capacity magazines that have been used in many mass shootings, the British newspaper said last week, adding that California is one of just two states, alongside New Jersey, to receive an ""A"" rating from the gun safety group Giffords, based on the strength of its firearm regulations. While gun rights proponents have cited the two shootings as evidence of the ineffectiveness of California's laws, groups like Giffords fiercely reject those arguments. Gun safety groups have noted dramatic decline in firearm mortality rate in California in the years since tougher regulations were enacted, it said. In a nation where firearms outnumber people, such horrific attacks will continue without a coordinated federal response to gun violence, it quoted the gun safety groups as saying. ""California is one state of 50,"" said Nick Suplina, senior vice-president for law and policy at the gun safety group Everytown. ""There's just no question that strong, uniform federal laws are substantially better than a mixed bag of strong and weak state laws.""",Xinhua,2023-02-07 10:43

Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi sent two separate messages to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad after the earthquakes, expressing Tehran's readiness to provide immediate rescue and relief aid to the two countries. In Beirut, where the tremors of earthquakes could be clearly felt, Lebanese caretaker Environment Minister Nasser Yassin said on Monday that ""a Lebanese rescue team will depart later in the day to Türkiye, at the request of Turkish authorities, to help with rescue operations."" The Lebanese Army Command announced that it will send 20 members of the Engineering Regiment to Türkiye to contribute to the search and rescue work. Israel also said it has dispatched two rescue teams to Türkiye and sent rescue equipment to Syria.   ""We are sending two teams of professionals in order to help the victims,"" Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said in the statement. ""Today, Israel stands by Türkiye in this difficult hour,"" he said. In a separate statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the teams would be sent following the request of the Turkish government. ""I have directed the dispatch of search and rescue, and medical teams,"" he said. The prime minister said that Israel will also send equipment to Syria, which would be a rare act of cooperation between Israel and Syria, two neighboring countries that have been in an official state of war.   Also on Monday, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry offered to help Türkiye and Syria, saying that ""Egypt is ready to provide aid to face the horrifying repercussions of the deadly earthquake."" The foreign ministry also expressed condolences and solidarity with the two countries. Meanwhile, Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune said that his country had sent a team of skilled rescue workers to help Türkiye. The Algerian rescue team, consisting of 89 experienced search and rescue personnel in addition to medical professionals, is scheduled to arrive in Türkiye on Monday, he noted.

785,UN chief calls for actions to change course before meltdown occurs,"UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday called on countries to take decisive action to change course before it is too late to prevent a global meltdown from occurring. While presenting his priorities for the year to the UN General Assembly, Guterres appealed for urgent action to achieve peace, economic rights and development, climate action, respect for diversity, and inclusive societies -- both today and for generations to come. The Ukraine crisis, the climate emergency, rising nuclear threats and the undermining of global norms and institutions have pushed the world closer to annihilation. Stressing the need for ""a course correction,"" the UN chief said taking action should be guided by the UN Charter, the organization's founding document, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The secretary-general called for a holistic view of the peace continuum that identifies root causes of conflict and focuses on prevention, mediation, reconciliation, peacebuilding and greater participation of women and young people. With poverty and hunger rising, developing countries drowning in debt, and social safety nets frayed, among other signs, the top UN official called for radical transformation of the global financial architecture. The world must unite now to mobilize resources, said Guterres, so that developing economies have the liquidity to invest in education, universal healthcare, pandemic preparedness, decent work and social protection. Countries are hurtling past the 1.5-degree limit on global temperature rise, therefore focus must be on the urgent priorities of cutting greenhouse gas emissions and achieving climate justice. He said global emissions must be halved this decade, including through ""far more ambitious action"" in shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy, especially in the G20 group of top industrialized nations. In respect to diversity and the universality of cultural rights, Guterres underlined the UN's commitment to protecting cultural rights and diversity. ""We will call for action from everyone with influence on the spread of mis- and disinformation on the internet -- governments, regulators, policymakers, technology companies, the media, civil society,"" he said. Guterres also pledged to ""double down"" on support for measures towards greater gender equality, including quotas to close gaps in women's representation in elections, corporate boardrooms and peace negotiations.",Xinhua,2023-02-07 15:18
780,U.S. four-star general's war speculation sparks criticism,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- Recent comments by a four-star general of the U.S. Air Force that the United States and China will fight a war in 2025 over Taiwan have been criticised as groundless speculation. Mike Minihan, commander of the Air Mobility Command (AMC), said in a memo sent to his subordinates that his ""guts"" told him that the United States and China ""will fight in 2025,"" basing on self-claimed scenarios. Minihan's comments triggered criticism from both military experts and public commentators in the United States. Responding to the comments by Minihan, who leads the Air Force's responsibility for transporting soldiers and weapons onto battlefields and refueling U.S. military aircraft mid-air, the U.S. Defense Department said in a statement that the general's assertions ""are not representative of the department's view on China."" ""There's no reason for the bilateral relationship -- the most consequential bilateral relationship in the world -- to sort of erupt into some kind of conflict,"" said John Kirby, the National Security Council's coordinator for strategic communication, when asked to comment on the matter. Even the direct recipients of Minihan's memo found it astonishingly ridiculous. U.S. military news portal Military.com quoted pilots and officers within the AMC as saying that predictions and corresponding directions contained in the memo are unrealistic and ""inappropriate."" ""Some of my airmen are going to get scared when they read this memo,"" one of the officers said. Anti-war activist and podcast host Jimmy Dore said in an appearance on Fox News that the United States' enemy is not China, but rather ""the military industrial complex fleecing this country to the tunes of hundreds of billions and trillions of dollars."" Dore said what's actually running the United States is a ""war machine"" that ""can not be stopped,"" leaving the American people who cheer for war with no idea whatsoever about their country's foreign policy. ""What is worse, they have no idea that they don't have any idea what is happening with the foreign policy."" ""Americans have no idea how corrupt our government is. They think our government is just regular corrupt ... that's not (the case) -- the whole thing is corrupt,"" Dore said. Having plunged the Middle East into constant war over the past 20 years, the United States, Dore said, is ""doing a proxy war in Ukraine"" that both itself and its allies admitted has been provoked by the West. ""Now we're trying to sabre-rattle this with China, and (those in the industrial-military complex) are 'predicting a war,'"" Dore said. ""Again, China won't invade us. China is not our enemy."" ""I remain skeptical,"" said George Friedman, founder and chairman of Geopolitical Futures. ""The Pentagon has distanced itself from the general's remarks,"" he said. Minihan was also criticized by Jude Blanchette, the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. The general's prediction -- together with similar speculations by other high-ranking U.S. military officials indicating ""various years"" in which a U.S.-China war would break out -- ""comes across as undermining the credibility of our statements and our assessments on precisely the relationship where your words matter,"" Blanchette said.",Xinhua,2023-02-07 15:25
783,Feature: Human experiments -- chilling crimes behind walls of U.S. prison,"PHILADELPHIA, United States, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- When Allen Hornblum began to work as a literacy instructor in Philadelphia's prison system in 1971, he immediately noticed something unusual and chilling behind the walls. Many inmates at Holmesburg Prison, most of them being African American men, had patches or gauze pads on their backs. Later, Hornblum found out those were the results of longtime and extensive human experimentations. ""It really is a very dark mark on Philadelphia's history,"" Hornblum told Xinhua during a recent interview outside Holmesburg while describing the prison, given the nickname The Terrordome, as ""arguably the largest human experimentation center in the United States."" The human trials were led by a dermatologist named Albert Kligman associated with the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). Hornblum, author of two books on the horrifying subject -- Acres of Skin and Sentenced to Science -- said that though the prisoners signed up to get paid for partaking in Kligman's research programs, they didn't really understand to what risk they would be exposed. ""The inmates were not particularly sophisticated. The vast majority of them were unschooled,"" Hornblum said based on interviews with dozens of prisoners and years of in-depth research after giving up his job in the Philadelphia Sheriff's Office in 1993. ""Even though they were the subjects, they were not told what they were being injected with or having rubbed on them."" Government records show that from 1951 to 1974, hundreds of Holmesburg inmates were intentionally exposed to pharmaceuticals, viruses, fungus, asbestos, and even dioxin. Many of the ""test subjects"" were awaiting prosecution, and attempting to save enough money to make bail. The experiments had different sponsors, including major pharmaceutical companies and the U.S. military. ""There were very few jobs in the jail. If you were lucky enough to get one, pushing a broom on a block, you may make 50 cents a day, 25 cents a day,"" Hornblum recalled. ""But if you were a test subject for Albert Kligman -- the lead doctor here -- you could make at least a dollar a day, in some cases, 1.5 to 2 dollars a day."" In return for the slim payment, the inmates had to suffer from symptoms such as skin itching, rashes, discolorations, and fevers, and in some cases, they became more violent. Nevertheless, they ""were left somewhat incompetent until they recovered from whatever drugs they had been given,"" said the author. ""They were basically forgotten, the way doctors use lab rats or dogs or monkeys or chimpanzees. They may inject them with something. They may rub something on them. They monitor them for a while. When the experiment is over, they basically discard them,"" he said. ""Whatever took place here with radioactive isotopes or dioxin or the chemical warfare agents, there was no follow-up."" After Acres of Skin was published in 1998, Holmesburg's inmates learned what had gone on for the first time and started to gather together. Subsequently, Hornblum met Edward Anthony, a test subject ""in a series of very, very nasty, unethical experiments that basically destroyed his life, or at least that portion of his life."" When Anthony got back on the street, he was ""still suffering in many ways,"" according to Hornblum, who later penned Sentenced to Science, ""basically one Black man's account of what happened to him as a human guinea pig."" Like other victims, Anthony developed ""a great distrust of doctors and medical institutions,"" Hornblum revealed. ""They don't trust the medical community anymore because they saw how themselves and others were mistreated and used and abused."" The Holmesburg victims filed suit but didn't get very far because of a statute of limitations in the state of Pennsylvania. Plus, Hornblum said these men ""were deceived"" and ""were made to file and sign their signature on waiver forms."" In October 2022, the city of Philadelphia issued a formal apology for experiments conducted on African American inmates at Holmesburg, saying that ""this is yet another tragic example of disgraceful and unethical practices of medical experimentation on people of color throughout our country's history."" Penn's School of Medicine -- where Kligman was a long-standing faculty member in the Department of Dermatology before his death in 2010 -- apologized in 2021 ""for the pain Dr. Kligman's work caused to incarcerated individuals, their families, and our broader community."" ""Penn Medicine acknowledges that the work done by Dr. Kligman was terribly disrespectful of individuals -- many of whom were imprisoned Black men -- denying them the autonomy and informed consent which the medical community now considers to be foundational underpinnings for conducting ethical research,"" it said in a statement. Hornblum said he believes the apologies ""should have happened years, if not decades earlier"" and that there ""really is an egregious sin of commission and omission there"" because ""it's all happening after Americans Juris write the Nuremberg Code,"" a set of ethical research principles delimiting permissible medical experimentation on human subjects. ""The medical community disregarded it. They didn't feel it was helpful. They didn't feel it was consistent with exploring the great scientific quests and quandaries. They thought it was an obstacle. So they didn't abide by it,"" he said. ""That's basically the sad commentary of this that some very smart people shoved ethics away because they saw it as an imposition, as a problem, as something that's gonna block them from their scientific quests. And that's why there are so many instances in prison and other institutions where people were used as guinea pigs for medical experimentation. Kligman, however, didn't appear to be remorseful for what he had done. Hornblum, who once interviewed Kligman prior to the publication of Acres of Skin, said: ""I don't believe his attitude ever changed. He saw this as a way to do experiments ... He walked through the big front doors of that prison and all he saw throughout the prison were not inmates, not people, but as he said, acres of skin."" Hornblum said, ""the American people, and particularly the medical community and the academic community, should recognize the egregious nature of what took place."" ""Some of their top doctors, scientists were part of a really outrageously destructive program to people. They basically used individuals -- African Americans, senior citizens, children with all sorts of learning disabilities,"" he said. ""They used them as raw material for experimentation and then discarded them.""",Xinhua,2023-02-07 15:27

779,Key facts U.S. deliberately ignores about African debt,"BEIJING, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- Like many senior U.S. officials who have visited Africa, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen did not fail to target China and raise concerns about China's role in the debt problem during a recent visit to the continent. While hyping up the bizarre ""Chinese debt trap,"" the U.S. officials deliberately ignored some key facts about African debt.  According to the World Bank's International Debt Statistics, multilateral financial institutions and commercial creditors hold nearly three-quarters of Africa's total external debt. A report published last July by the British NGO Debt Justice showed that 12 percent of the external debt of African countries is owed to Chinese lenders, compared to 35 percent to Western private lenders. The average interest rate of these private loans is 5 percent, compared with 2.7 percent for loans from Chinese public and private lenders. ""Western leaders blame China for debt crises in Africa, but this is a distraction. The truth is their own banks, asset managers and oil traders are far more responsible, but the G7 (the Group of Seven) are letting them off the hook,"" said Tim Jones, head of policy at Debt Justice. In Chad, for example, the Swiss multinational commodity trading and mining company Glencore possesses about one-third of the country's external debt, while for Zambia, the American multinational investment company BlackRock is a major creditor, reported the French daily newspaper Le Monde on Jan. 30. While calling for immediately addressing Zambia's heavy debt burden with China, Yellen deliberately ignored the fact that multilateral financial institutions and commercial creditors hold most of the country's external debt. According to figures released by Zambia's Ministry of Finance and Planning, multilateral financial institutions account for 24 percent of the country's foreign debt, while predominantly Western commercial lenders account for 46 percent. ""Western lenders for long have not been put on the spotlight for debt relief because they successfully managed to dupe the world that it's only Chinese lenders that pose a threat to Africa,"" Uganda-based Vision Group journalist Mubarak Mugabo said.  The causes of the debt crisis are multifaceted: the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical conflicts, a decline in global economic growth and economic structure vulnerabilities, among many other things, could all exacerbate the debt situation of some African countries. Persistent inflation, prolonged tightening of global financial conditions, the high cost of capital, domestic currency depreciations and lower financial inflows could increase the risks of debt distress in some African countries, according to Africa's Macroeconomic Performance and Outlook published in January 2023 by the African Development Bank (AfDB). In particular, the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate hikes and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar have greatly added to the debt service burden of African countries, the AfDB pointed out. For example, Ghana's currency, the cedi, depreciated more than 33.4 percent against the U.S. dollar in 2022. Since most of the debt that emerging and low-income countries should be paid in a foreign currency, notably the U.S. dollar and Euro, irresponsible U.S.-government policies have added fuel to the fire. In contrast, China has been an ardent supporter of the Group of 20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative. The country has signed agreements or reached consensus with 19 African countries on debt relief and has suspended the most debt service payments of any G20 member. China has also actively addressed the debt of Chad, Ethiopia and Zambia on a case-by-case basis within the G20 framework. ""They depict China as a predatory lender that is weaponizing capital in order to practice a new form of colonialism in Africa. However, such accusations have little factual basis,"" noted Costantinos Bt. Costantinos, professor of public policy at the Addis Ababa University in Ethiopia. ""The debt trap issue has been a political smear,"" said Charles Onunaiju, director of the Nigeria-based Center for China Studies, adding that such claims are just a red herring to absolve the West of any responsibility.  During trips to Africa, American officials may not have realized that when they disembarked from a plane, they were likely headed toward a terminal built by a Chinese company. And their cars were also driving on roads or bridges built by a Chinese contractor. Modern infrastructure built by China is ubiquitous across Africa. The increase in debt stock could also be a positive sign, and not just a pathology, according to an article published in June last year on the website of The Africa Report. Many sub-Saharan African economies experienced record growth before the pandemic. When gross domestic product increases, it is normal for debt to follow. Suppose external debt contributes to a country's economic and social development in the long term and can be adequately managed. In that case, it could be called good debt, or in other words, financial aid for development. Therefore, debt growth is only a trivial aspect of the problem. The rub is how to help African countries achieve sustainable, independent and high-quality development resulting in a balance of development financing and debt growth. ""China's financial assistance to Africa is largely aimed at realizing socio-economic and cultural projects of great importance, such as road infrastructure, hospitals, schools, bridges, etc.,"" Amadou Diop, a Senegalese expert on China, told Xinhua. Statistics showed that since the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation was founded almost 23 years ago, Chinese companies have built or upgraded more than 10,000 km of railways, nearly 100,000 km of roads, roughly 1,000 bridges and 100 ports, and several hospitals and schools in Africa, creating more than 4.5 million jobs. Published last July by a fellow in South Africa's University of Fort Hare, a quantitative study of the impact of China's loans on growth in 15 African countries concluded that China's efforts in developing infrastructure translate into economic growth. According to the study, China has been and continues to be a significant force in assisting African countries in financing their development. A survey issued last year by the Inter Region Economic Network, a Kenya-based think tank, found that China takes a substantial lead in decision-making and timely completion of infrastructure projects such as roads, power dams, railways and bridges in Africa. Facts and figures in the study showed that through efficient action, China tangibly contributes to Africa's development. ""There is a common feeling among African countries,"" said Ezzat Saad, director of the Egyptian Council for Foreign Affairs, ""that China is a reliable partner, and there is a great trust and credibility in China-Africa cooperation.""",Xinhua,2023-02-07 16:10
397,"Quake death toll in Türkiye, Syria crosses 6,000, with calls mounting to lift U.S. sanctions on Syria","  ANKARA/DAMASCUS, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from Monday's devastating earthquakes climbed to 5,434 in Trkiye and 812 in Syria on Tuesday, while calls mounted to lift the U.S. sanctions on Syria. The number of injured rose to 31,777 and 1,449 respectively in Trkiye and Syria, according to Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca and the media office at the Aleppo governorate headquarters. The death toll in both countries is expected to rise further as the rescue operations are hampered by bad weather. A powerful magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck Trkiye's southern province of Kahramanmaras at 4:17 a.m. local time (0117 GMT) on Monday, followed by a magnitude 6.4 quake a few minutes later in the country's southern province of Gaziantep and a magnitude 7.6 earthquake at 1:24 p.m. local time (1024 GMT) in Kahramanmaras. Trkiye's southern province of Hatay and Syria's northern Aleppo city suffered the biggest loss of lives, while Lebanon, Israel and Cyprus also felt the tremor. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared a three-month state of emergency on Tuesday in 10 of the country's provinces hit by the quakes. The decision was taken in order to ensure that search and rescue activities and subsequent studies can be carried out quickly, he said at a press conference.  As the rescue effort was underway in quake-hit regions, the Syrian Foreign Ministry on Tuesday slammed the U.S. sanctions for blocking the humanitarian work and rescue operations in the war-torn country. In a statement, the ministry said that the Syrians, while dealing with the earthquake catastrophe, are digging among rubbles with their own hands or using the simplest tools as the equipment for removing the rubbles is banned by the U.S. sanctions. It also said that the Syrians are also denied access to medicines and medical equipment that would help them face dangers and diseases. Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) President Khaled Hboubati on Tuesday called for lifting the U.S. and Western sanctions on Syria to facilitate relief efforts as the country is in dire need of rescue equipment. Speaking at a press conference in Damascus, the Syrian capital, Hboubati stressed that the SARC needs equipment, ambulances and heavy machinery, but ""the main obstacle is the sanctions imposed on Syria, which we demand to be lifted immediately."" The Iranian Foreign Ministry on Tuesday called on different countries to pressure the U.S. to lift the sanctions on Syria. The ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani made the remarks in an exclusive interview with the semi-official Mehr news agency on Monday, parts of which were released on Tuesday. He urged other countries to force the U.S. to lift the siege of the Arab state so that international humanitarian aid can be delivered to the quake-stricken people without any obstacle and at the shortest time.  Two days into the deadly earthquake, more countries joined the rescue and relief efforts underway in Syria and Trkiye. Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, president of the United Arab Emirates, has ordered an aid package totaling 100 million U.S. dollars for earthquake relief in Syria and Trkiye, which will split the aid equally, the Emirates News Agency reported on Tuesday. Also on Tuesday, Saudi Arabian King Salman bin Abdulaziz and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the operation of an air bridge to provide various aid to help the earthquake victims in Syria and Trkiye. The official Saudi Press Agency reported that the air bridge will provide health, shelter, food and logistical assistance to alleviate the effects of the earthquake on the Syrian and Turkish people. Jordan, for its part, sent on Tuesday humanitarian aid and rescue teams to Syria and Trkiye to help search for survivors. Lebanon, bordering Syria, also sent on Tuesday morning a delegation to its neighbor to assist the rescue operations in Syria. Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi made separate phone calls to his Turkish and Syrian counterparts on Tuesday, extending his condolences to the victims of the deadly earthquakes. On the same day, Egypt sent five military planes loaded with medical supplies to both quake-stricken countries. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi on Tuesday also made separate phone calls to his Turkish and Syrian counterparts, expressing readiness to offer assistance for the relief efforts. Iran has already sent three batches of humanitarian aid to Syria, Iranian Ambassador to Damascus Mehdi Sobhani was quoted by the semi-official Tasnim news agency as saying on Tuesday.

400,"Rescue efforts intensify as devastating earthquakes kill about 5,000 in Türkiye, Syria","ANKARA/DAMASCUS, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- The international community has pledged support for Türkiye and Syria after devastating earthquakes jolted vast swathes of the two neighboring countries on Monday. Rescuers are braving harsh weather and the risk of more quakes to save survivors from the wreckage. About 5,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands injured as of Tuesday noon by the devastating earthquakes that could also be felt in Lebanon, Cyprus, Israel and other surrounding countries. Aid and condolences poured in from world leaders as Türkiye and Syria called on the global community to help.  A magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck Türkiye's southern province of Kahramanmaras at 4:17 a.m. local time (0117 GMT), followed by a magnitude 6.4 quake minutes later in the southern province of Gaziantep and a magnitude 7.6 earthquake at 1:24 p.m. (1024 GMT) in Kahramanmaras. At least 78 aftershocks were recorded, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said Monday. Meteorological authorities monitored several magnitude 5.0 or stronger tremors in the afternoon.   In Türkiye, the death toll climbed to 3,419, at least 20,534 others were injured, and more than 5,775 buildings destroyed, according to official data. In the wake of the deadly quakes, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared national mourning for a week, saying, ""Turkish flag will be hoisted at half-mast until sunset on Sunday all around Türkiye, at all foreign representations."" More than 1,500 people died, and some 3,500 were injured in Syria, according to the Syrian health ministry and local authorities. Historic sites in Syria were affected. ""Parts of the Ottoman mill in the Citadel"" of Aleppo have collapsed, and the defensive walls have cracks, said Syria's antiquities and museums directorate. Monday's earthquake is believed to be the strongest in Türkiye since the magnitude 7.9 tremor in eastern Erzincan Province left 33,000 people dead in 1939. Earthquakes frequently strike Türkiye due to its tectonic location. In 2020, the country recorded almost 33,000 earthquakes in the region, including 332 at magnitudes of 4.0 and higher, the country's emergency authority said. The country should undergo a massive campaign to reconstruct cities threatened by natural disasters, Turkish seismology expert Ovgun Ahmet Ercan told the media.  In Türkiye, residents who had fled from their homes in pajamas and T-shirts were waiting on streets covered by ice and snow. Many people were trying to leave the quake-hit areas, causing traffic jams and hindering emergency efforts, Türkiye's NTV reported.   In northern Syria's Aleppo Province, one of the worst-affected Syrian areas, people have yet to recover from shock and panic. In the Karm al-Jabal neighborhood in the provincial capital of Aleppo, local resident Muhammad Boushi was overwhelmed by the shock, not knowing what to do with his brother's family trapped under rubble. Boushi was luckily awakened by the tremor and fled his house before it collapsed. ""We felt the earthquake and immediately took to the streets. Everyone left and took shelter on the streets. And we heard that buildings had collapsed, so we came to help,"" he told Xinhua. ""The civilians started to help rescue people from under the rubble, whether dead or alive. My 37-year-old brother, his wife, and their three children are still under the rubble. We are trying to contact them via mobile phone. It's ringing, but no one is answering,"" Boushi said anxiously. ""Around 4:30 in the morning, homes started to shake, so we woke up and went down to the streets. We heard a bang, and we rushed to see what was going on and tried to help. I hope all those under the rubble stay alive,"" said Mahmoud Muhammad, who lives in the nearby al-Shaar area. Mamdouh Barot, another resident in the area, told Xinhua he and his family left their apartment before it started to crumble. When they got to the street, their building's upper floors collapsed in front of their eyes. Barot lived on the ground floor and risked returning to grab some belongings. ""When I came out, I heard a big noise. So we ran, not daring to look back. When we returned there later, we found the building had totally collapsed,"" he said.  Türkiye issued a level-4 alarm after the earthquake, which included a call for international aid. The Turkish Red Crescent and the country's emergency authority have dispatched rescue teams to the stricken area. The Turkish security forces, search and rescue volunteers and local rescue personnel also participated in the quake-relief work.   Some 3,500 soldiers have participated in rescue operations, Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said, noting 17 aircraft loaded with aid supplies are flying to the region from Istanbul, Izmir and Ankara. The Turkish Defense Ministry has set up an air corridor to facilitate search and rescue teams to reach the disaster sites. Disaster and Emergency Management Authority President Yunus Sezer said nearly 15,000 rescue personnel and about 5,000 vehicles and construction equipment had been deployed in the region. However, a winter blizzard and freezing conditions hampered search and rescue efforts. Current temperatures were colder than seasonal averages, below 10 degrees Celsius in most affected regions. The weather service forecasted rain and sleet across southeastern Türkiye until Thursday. The Syrian government has set up a 24-hour central operation center led by Prime Minister Hussein Arnous to coordinate earthquake relief operations. All relevant ministries, institutions and authorities were on alert, state news agency SANA reported. In Aleppo, rescuers used bulldozers and shovels to pry open building rubble to search for survivors in the region enveloped by snow and rain on Monday. Some rescuers struggled to pull casualties out of the debris with their bare hands. In Hama Province in central Syria, rescue work continues, with shelters secured for people who lost their homes in the earthquakes, Interior Minister Mohammad Khaled al-Rahmoun told Xinhua at the site of a collapsed building in the province's al-Arabeen neighborhood. Standing by a seven-story building in Hama, home to 100-150 people, Alaa Shaker, coordinator of the emergency unit at the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, said only 45 of the dwellers had been rescued. ""We have reports on deaths between 15 and 20 people under the building,"" he added.  World leaders have expressed solidarity with the people of Türkiye and Syria and their condolences to the families of the victims, pledging to mobilize support.   ""My heart goes out to the people of Türkiye and Syria in this hour of tragedy,"" said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in a statement after the quakes. ""The United Nations is fully committed to supporting the response. Our teams are on the ground assessing the needs and providing assistance."" China has launched an emergency humanitarian assistance mechanism and will provide emergency aid to quake-hit Türkiye and Syria, said Deng Boqing, deputy head of the China International Development Cooperation Agency, on Tuesday. China will provide the first batch of emergency aid worth 40 million yuan (about 5.89 million U.S. dollars) to Türkiye, sending a rescue team and a medical team in the shortest time, he added.   Iran, Lebanon, India, Egypt, Russia, France, Finland and other countries worldwide have also expressed their readiness to help Türkiye and Syria. More than 100 Russian rescuers have arrived in Türkiye to assist in the aftermath of the deadly earthquakes, the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations said on Tuesday. Algeria and Libya pledged to send rescue workers to help with the aftermath. Israel said it would dispatch two rescue teams to Türkiye following the request of the Turkish government. Erdogan said Ankara has received offers of help from some 45 countries.",Xinhua,2023-02-08 08:18
401,Institutional racism dampens neighborhood walkability of populations of color in U.S. -- study,"   WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- Despite living in neighborhoods with higher walkability scores, Black, Hispanic, and Asian people were less likely to engage in physical activity near their homes, said a recent study from the Boston University School of Public Health (BUSPH). This trend was tied to differences in other built environmental factors, like perceived safety and neighborhood quality, that could discourage individuals from going outside near their homes, said the researchers of the study, which was published in the journal Obesity. It pointed out that established institutional racism and redlining in the United States have made neighborhood walkability a moot point for populations of color. ""In cities and counties across the U.S., the legacy of racial residential segregation and policies like redlining resulted in poorer built physical activity environments, characterized by decreased walkability, street connectivity, and green space, and increased pollution that disproportionately impact communities of color,"" the study's lead author, Monica Wang, ScD, associate professor of community health sciences at BUSPH, said in a public statement.",Xinhua,2023-02-08 08:55

The directive was issued in a letter signed by Raisi to the Iranian Foreign Ministry, according to the website of the Iranian president's office. Last week, Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf submitted the law for Iran's SCO membership to Raisi for final approval and implementation. The move followed the Iranian Constitutional Council spokesman's announcement that the vetting body had approved the bill on the country's membership in the SCO.

402,"UNESCO fears damage to Syrian, Turkish heritage following devastating earthquakes","   PARIS, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on Tuesday expressed concerns over damage to Syrian and Turkish heritage sites, and vowed support for the two earthquake-devastated countries. Following an initial survey of damage to heritage carried out alongside national authorities, UNESCO said: ""In Syria, UNESCO is particularly concerned about the situation in the Ancient city of Aleppo, which is on the List of World Heritage in Danger."" Significant damage had been noted in the citadel, UNESCO said. The western tower of the old city wall had collapsed, and several buildings in the souks had been weakened.   Meanwhile, in Türkiye, several buildings in the city of Diyarbakir have collapsed. The city is home to the World Heritage site ""Diyarbakir Fortress and Hevsel Gardens Cultural Landscape"", an important center for the Roman, Sassanid, Byzantine, Islamic and Ottoman periods. UNESCO's experts, with the cooperation of national authorities, are trying to establish a precise inventory of the damage to sites on the World Heritage List. ""My condolences go out to the families and loved ones of those who died. My thoughts are also with the injured and all those affected. Our Organization will provide assistance within its mandate,"" said Audrey Azoulay, UNESCO's Director-General. A powerful magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck Türkiye's southern province of Kahramanmaras at 4:17 a.m. local time (0117 GMT) on Monday, followed by a magnitude 6.4 quake a few minutes later in the country's southern province of Gaziantep, and a magnitude 7.6 earthquake at 1:24 p.m. local time (1024 GMT) in Kahramanmaras.   The death toll in Türkiye climbed to 5,434 on Tuesday, while the number of people injured rose to 31,777, Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said.

403,Protests continue in France against gov't pension reform plans,"   PARIS, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 757,000 people took to the streets across France on Tuesday to demand government to drop its proposed pension reforms, the ministry of interior said on Tuesday. However, the CGT, France's largest union, said that the turnout exceeded two million during the third day of the general mobilization against the pension reform that would raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Turnout at the previous nationwide demonstration on Jan. 31 was estimated by the ministry at 1.2 million and by the CGT at 2.8 million. In Paris, where the ministry counted 57,000 demonstrators, police forces used tear gas to disperse the crowds that sparked clashes. By 6 p.m. local time, 17 people had been arrested.   Similarly to the previous two general mobilizations, workers from several public sectors went on strike on Tuesday. However, there were fewer strikers among teachers and in the public services than on Jan. 31. Rail traffic was severely disrupted on Tuesday, and two unions representing employees of the French national railway company SNCF said that the strike was to continue on Wednesday. A third of high-speed TGV trains as well as half of regional and intercity trains are to be canceled. The French multinational electricity company EDF said that more than 30 percent of its employees were on strike at midday on Tuesday, which had greatly affected electricity production by late Tuesday morning. The mobilization remained strong in TotalEnergies where, according to the CGT, the strike rate varied between 75 percent and 100 percent. Although deliveries of petrol products from TotalEnergies sites were interrupted, the company's management said that there was ""no lack of fuel"" in the group's service stations.   In a joint press release, eight unions called on ""the entire population to demonstrate even more massively on Saturday, Feb. 11, throughout the territory to say no to this reform."" Also on Tuesday, the French National Assembly kicked off a debate on the planned pension reform. On Jan. 10, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne laid out details of the plan, which would progressively raise the legal retirement age by three months a year from 62 to 64 by 2030, and introduce a guaranteed minimum pension. Starting in 2027, the plan would also require at least 43 years of work to be eligible for a full pension.",Xinhua,2023-02-08 09:11

404,Nurses in Britain walk out over payment amid strained medical services,"  LONDON, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- Nurses and ambulance workers in Britain on Monday started another round of strikes in the thick of lengthy and intensifying disputes over payment. Health workers won support amid a raging cost-of-living crisis, and the industrial action was feared to put more pressure on the medical system.  Nursing staff were set to strike again in England on Monday and Tuesday. The two-day walkouts will be at the highest intensity in the union's history, taking place at 73 National Health Service (NHS) trusts in England, compared to 44 in December and 55 in January, according to the Royal College of Nursing (RCN). Members of other health unions were also on strike, making Monday the single biggest day of strike action in the 75-year history of the NHS, the RCN added, noting that the Welsh government made an offer to NHS staff of an additional 3 percent pay rise and the planned strike action in Wales for this week was canceled. ""Your government looks increasingly isolated in refusing to reopen discussions about the 2022-23 NHS pay award. As a result, the strike action for England remains -- with tens of thousands of nurses losing wages to ensure you hear their voice,"" said RCN General Secretary Pat Cullen. ""It must not be in vain."" Also on Monday, ambulance workers represented by trade unions Unite, Unison and the GMB in trusts across England, Northern Ireland and Wales took strike action. ""This dispute will only be resolved when it enters into proper negotiations about the current pay dispute,"" said Unite national lead officer Onay Kasab. ""The government's constant attempts to kick the can down the road and its talk about one off payments, or slightly increased pay awards in the future, is simply not sufficient to resolve this dispute."" In response, the British government has said the pay rises are unaffordable and that higher pay will not help fight raging inflation. Minister for Mental Health and Women's Health Strategy Maria Caulfield on Monday called on the RCN to suspend strikes in England to allow for pay negotiations. The government has a responsibility to all taxpayers and every one percent increase is about 700 million pounds (842 million U.S. dollars) that the government has to find, Caulfield told Sky News.  Since the beginning of its action, the RCN has asked for a pay rise above inflation. The value of salaries for experienced nurses is 20 percent lower in real terms since 2010, due to successive below-inflation pay awards, said the union in December. Back in November, Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Steve Barclay tweeted that the government has accepted the recommendations of the NHS Pay Review Body to give nurses a pay rise of at least 1,400 pounds (1,685 dollars), and this means a newly qualified nurse will typically earn over 31,000 pounds (37,302 dollars) a year. While the RCN was demanding a pay rise of 17.6 percent, it was ""an increase around three times the average settlement that millions of hardworking people outside the public sector are getting,"" Barclay added. Britain has been in the grip of consistently high inflation because of both global and domestic factors. Its consumer price index rose at an annual rate of 10.5 percent in December, and the cost-of-living crisis facing households continued as food inflation remained historically high, official figures showed. Meanwhile, wages have failed to keep up for a long time. ""The lack of growth in average real-terms earnings since the financial crisis is clear,"" noted a report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies in October. Average public sector earnings in July 2022 were 4 percent lower in real terms than in July 2007, it showed. ""The very large number of strikes, very much concentrated in the public sector or previously public sector occupations, is really the result of an unprecedentedly long period of downward pressure on pay,"" Deborah Dean, co-director of the Industrial Relations Research Unit at the Warwick Business School, has told Xinhua. Dean said health services were under great strain. ""You can't go on, particularly after the acute pressures of the pandemic, where extraordinary demands were made on NHS staff, and in particular frontline staff nurses and doctors, and people have left through ill health, through the pressures,"" she noted.  Back in July 2022, a Health and Social Care Committee report said the NHS and social care sectors ""are facing the greatest workforce crisis in their history."" An official briefing showed the total number of NHS vacancies in June 2022 was 132,139, a vacancy rate of 9.7 percent, which was an increase from the previous year, when the number of vacancies was 98,827 and the rate was 7.6 percent. ""Pay and employment have reduced. Funding has reduced. And this has meant people are both effectively being paid less and also their work is intensified because there are fewer people doing the necessary jobs,"" Dean said, noting that it in particular is one of the reasons why nurses went on strike. Patients were suffering. Poor health and unprecedented NHS waiting lists are forcing people out of work, the RCN noted earlier this month. Data shows 6.9 million were waiting for NHS treatment in England as of November 2022, almost one million more than the previous year, it added. ""People are having to wait longer to access services when demand has never been greater,"" RCN Director for England Patricia Marquis said. ""Patients are not dying because nurses are striking. Nurses are striking because patients are dying."" But analysis showed that the ongoing strikes also put more strains on the medical system. NHS England data showed that more than 5,000 operations and 30,000 outpatient appointments had needed to be rescheduled across strike days, according to the NHS Confederation in January. Commenting on the Monday strikes, Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said: ""This escalation takes us deeper into the situation NHS leaders have been warning against -- a war of attrition between the government and unions spanning several months at a time when NHS services are seeing unprecedented pressures."" ""We're increasingly concerned about the cumulative impact of strike days and record demand -- the longer this vicious cycle continues the longer it will take for the NHS to tackle the elective backlog,"" Taylor said.

The death toll from Monday's powerful earthquakes in southern Trkiye rose to 3,549, said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan upon declaring that a three-month state of emergency is enacted in 10 affected provinces. Meanwhile, the number of wounded people stood at 21,103, Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Authority said in an update. Two major earthquakes of 7.7 and 7.6 magnitudes hit the province of Kahramanmaras Monday. At least 78 aftershocks were recorded, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay has said. Turkish NTV broadcaster warned that the toll could rise dramatically as foul weather hampered the rescuers in the south while increasing the risk of hypothermia among those who remained under the rubble overnight. News footage from NTV showed dozens of rescuers and volunteers searching through the ruins of multi-story apartment blocks through the night under the snow in the southeastern Diyarbakir province. Mosques, gymnasiums, and schools were opened for people who might need to take shelter. However, power aftershocks have kept many people from staying indoors. TV footage displayed people from Kahramanmaras spending the night in cars, some wrapped themselves in blankets to repel the freezing weather. Turkish authorities have dispatched a total of 12,181 search and rescue workers to the quake zones, including 3,294 foreign emergency personnel sent by 14 countries, Oktay said on Tuesday. The emergency operations are being hampered by a winter blizzard as the temperatures recorded as minus 10 degrees Celsius in most of the 10 affected provinces. At least 5,775 buildings were damaged and more than 8,000 people have been pulled out of the rubbles, but the teams were also struggling with ""extremely severe weather conditions,"" Oktay said. The magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck Trkiye's southern province of Kahramanmaras at 4:17 a.m. local time (0117 GMT) on Monday, followed by a magnitude 6.4 quake a few minutes later in the nearby Gaziantep Province, and a magnitude 7.6 earthquake at 1:24 p.m. local time (1024 GMT) in the Kahramanmaras Province. The quakes were also felt in Lebanon, Israel and Cyprus. Trkiye's southern province of Hatay bordering Syria suffered the most loss of life in the earthquake with at least 872 casualties. In Hatay, roads and an airport runway were ruptured and numerous buildings, including two hospitals, collapsed in the quake. Hatay Mayor Lutfu Savas told Halk TV broadcaster that search and rescue teams could only arrive in the namesake city till Tuesday morning due to ruined roads and blocked transportation amid heavy snow. He stressed that there was also a serious communication problem in the city. The Port of Iskenderun district in Hatay continues to burn with massive flames after some containers started burning for an undetermined reason on Monday, the semi-official Anadolu Agency reported. Firefighter efforts to control the flames continue, but locals still share images of dense black smoke rising from the port. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday declared seven days of national mourning for the victims. Monday's earthquake is believed to be the strongest in Trkiye since the magnitude 7.9 tremor in eastern Erzincan Province that killed 33,000 people in 1939. In 1999, a magnitude 7.4 earthquake struck central and western Trkiye on Aug. 17. Later on Nov. 12, a magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck western Trkiye. The two earthquakes killed around 18,000 people, injured 43,000 others and left 600,000 people homeless. Trkiye sits at the intersection of three major tectonic plates: the African plate, the Eurasian plate and the Arabian plate, and around 42 percent of its territory is situated in a seismically active region, which is why the country is so prone to earthquakes.

791,110 Americans die every day from gun violence: USA Today,"   NEW YORK, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- An average of 110 Americans die daily from gun violence, far above the rate of gun deaths for any comparable nation, according to a recent USA Today report. The United States has about 12 gun deaths for every 100,000 residents, almost four times the rate of the next-highest country, Switzerland, said the report, citing experts. Most mass shootings were carried out by white shooters, according to the informatics group Statista. Mass shootings are just a small subset of all gun violence though. Accidental shootings, at times deadly, are often perpetrated by children, according to the gun-limits group Everytown for Gun Safety. Last year, children committed at least 321 accidental shootings, killing 143 people. When it comes to victims, Black Americans are twice as likely as white Americans to die from gun violence and 14 times more likely than white Americans to be wounded, the report quoted the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence as saying.",Xinhua,2023-02-08 13:07
792,"U.S. government abuses public health crises to gain, maintain power: expert","   NEW YORK, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- The pretext of public health and safety has proven to be a good fulcrum, a good lever to get people to do things that otherwise they would be very reluctant to do, U.S. news portal The Daily Signal reported on Monday, citing an expert. Many COVID-19 restrictions and mandates have been rolled back, but the infrastructure remains in place, ""ready and waiting for the next declared public health crisis,"" said Aaron Kheriaty, a psychiatrist who directs the Bioethics and American Democracy program at the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington. Kheriaty chose to speak out against the COVID-19 vaccine mandates, which cost him his job at the University of California, Irvine, School of Medicine, according to the report. ""It's also been an occasion for the accumulation of power, mostly by the executive branch of government,"" he said. Unless placed in check, the government will use public health orders to further its own agenda, whether about COVID-19, climate change, or abortion, he added.",Xinhua,2023-02-08 13:08
787,"With virus threat easing, U.S. hospitals still as full as ever: media","   NEW YORK, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- The winter triple threat of flu, COVID-19 and RSV is easing across the United States, but hospitals are still about as full as they've ever been during the pandemic and that doesn't seem likely to change any time soon, reported CNN on Monday. Hospitals were facing capacity and resource challenges long before the pandemic hit, experts were quoted as saying, in large part because the people who are being admitted are sicker than they were before. ""It's been a continuing trend over the last decade or so that there's been this greater acuity of patients inside the hospitals,"" said Nancy Foster, vice president for quality and patient safety with the American Hospital Association. ""So what you see is this incredibly sick group of people inside of hospitals. If you're a doctor or nurse or respiratory therapist or pharmacist or any other health professional working inside the hospital, that means it's always a difficult puzzle you're trying to solve to help that patient out,"" she noted. A mix of complicating factors were exacerbated during the pandemic, experts said, straining resources more than ever. ""Length of stay is longer because people are needing more acute care. Because of work force pressures, there are not as many people who can be treated in an inpatient setting all at once,"" Aaron Wesolowski, vice president of policy research, analytics and strategy at the American Hospital Association, was quoted as saying.",Xinhua,2023-02-08 13:16
794,Black Americans suffering from Long COVID have trouble accessing care: ABC News,"   NEW YORK, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Black Americans have made up a disproportionate share of cases, hospitalizations and deaths compared to any other racial or ethnic group, and now, doctors and advocates are warning that the Black community is facing another barrier: access to Long COVID care, reported ABC News on Monday. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey, with the latest update conducted between Jan. 4 and Jan. 16, 28.7 percent of Black respondents said they currently have or have had Long COVID. One Black Long COVID patient Chimére Smith, a 40-year-old former middle school English teacher from Baltimore, Maryland, said she paid more than a dozen visits to doctors and hospitals asking for help, but was discharged after every visit with no treatment plan in place. ""There is a history of distrust when it comes to the Black community and the health care system due to beliefs among patients that doctors won't treat them as well as their white counterparts. A 2012 meta-analysis found Black patients were 22 percent less likely than white patients to receive any pain medication,"" said the report. Long COVID occurs when patients who were infected with the COVID-19 virus have lingering symptoms for more than four weeks after recovering. In some cases, these symptoms can persist for months or even years.",Xinhua,2023-02-08 13:17
389,Spain ends face mask mandate on public transport,"MADRID, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- People in Spain will no longer have to wear face masks on public transport from Feb. 8 after the decision was taken to end their obligatory use as a protection against COVID-19 during Tuesday's cabinet meeting. The decision is the latest towards the normalization of life in Spain after the COVID-19 pandemic, with the obligatory use of facemasks in most indoor settings ending on April 20, 2022, and outdoors a year ago, on Feb. 10. ""We are following the roadmap that we planned to return to normality,"" Spain's Minister for Health, Carolina Darias, told journalists. Face masks will, however, still have to be worn in hospitals, health centers and pharmacies ""due to the vulnerability of the people who are there,"" the minister said. The country's epidemiological situation is steadily improving, Darias said. On Feb. 3, the 14-day notification rate of new COVID-19 cases in the country's population aged 60 years and over stood at 50.76 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, almost 50 points lower than the 97.60 cases per 100,000 inhabitants registered on Jan. 20.

384,UNEP says anti-microbial resistance threat to global health security,"NAIROBI, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- The growing crisis of antimicrobial resistance presents an existential threat to the health of humans, animals, food crops, and the natural world, says the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in a report launched in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi on Tuesday. Partly fueled by untreated waste emanating from mechanized agriculture and healthcare industries, antimicrobial resistance could trigger up to 10 million deaths annually by 2050, similar to the 2020 rate of global cancer fatalities, the report says. In addition, the inability of drugs widely used to treat infections caused by pathogens like viruses, bacteria, and fungi could lead to an about 3.4-trillion-U.S.-dollar slump in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) annually, pushing an additional 24 million people on the verge of extreme poverty, according to the UNEP report. Executive Director of the UNEP Inger Andersen noted that drivers of ecological degradation like pollution and biodiversity loss are also worsening antimicrobial resistance, to the detriment of the global sustainability agenda. ""The impacts of antimicrobial resistance could destroy our health and food systems. Cutting down pollution is a prerequisite for another century of progress toward zero hunger and good health,"" said Andersen. Under the title of ""Bracing for Superbugs: Strengthening environmental action in the One Health response to antimicrobial resistance"", the report notes that industrial pollution, disruptions in the natural world, and extreme weather events are also behind the spread of superbugs, which are resistant to conventional drugs. The global burden of antimicrobial resistance, if unchecked, could worsen poverty, gender inequalities, and food insecurity, the UNEP said, noting that listed antimicrobial resistance among the top ten threats to global health security. ""Failing to address the global burden of antimicrobial resistance, including its environmental dimensions, could take humanity back to an era when even mild infections could become deadly,"" the report says. In a bid to tame the antimicrobial resistance crisis, the UNEP report proposes better management of waste from pharmaceutical and agriculture sectors, the use of degradable antibiotics, the establishment of a robust monitoring and regulatory regime, collaborative research, and public awareness.",Xinhua,2023-02-08 13:26
385,Much work remains to be done to tackle anti-Asian racism in U.S.,"  NEW YORK, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- There is still much work to be done in the United States to address deep-rooted hate and discrimination against Asian Americans about one year after multiple deadly cases sending shocking waves across the country. Key initiatives included in the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which was signed into law by U.S. President Joe Biden in May 2021, have yet to be launched, according to a report by USA TODAY on Tuesday. The legislation was designed to curb anti-Asian hate crimes by creating a position at the Justice Department to expedite a review of COVID-19-related hate crimes; providing grants for states to create hotlines for reporting hate crimes and for law enforcement training aimed at preventing and identifying hate crimes; and directing federal agencies to work with community organizations to help raise awareness about hate crimes during the pandemic. Biden is scheduled to deliver his second State of the Union address on Tuesday evening and it's not clear if he will mention violence and hate towards the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community as he did in his first State of the Union address. ""Racism against Chinese Americans and the AAPI community isn't new. It's existed in the United States for nearly 200 years, despite the many contributions that Chinese Americans have made to the United States in fields such as healthcare, science, technology, business and the arts,"" said Zhengyu Huang, president of the Committee of 100, a nonprofit leadership organization of prominent Chinese Americans.   ""Chinese Americans are still seen as the perpetual foreigner, strangers in our own homeland. And post COVID, reports of discrimination, racism, and violence towards Americans of Chinese and Asian descent have significantly increased -- and these are only the incidents captured or reported,"" Huang told Xinhua via email in a recent interview. Trigger events like the COVID-19 and irresponsible comments from former U.S. President Donald Trump led to the surge of discrimination against Asian Americans, according to Haipei Shue, president of United Chinese Americans (UCA), a nonpartisan and nonprofit coalition based in Washington, D.C. There have been bias and stereotypes against Asian Americans throughout the history of the United States and the issue of hate against Asian Americans may not be tackled in a short time, said Shue in a recent interview with Xinhua. Shue noted that the stabbing of an Asian student from Indiana University by a white woman on Jan. 11 was apparently racial motivated. ""We are a nation of immigrants with a history of discrimination and exploitation of minority groups. We are still learning from the mistakes of the past. Asian Americans have contributed mightily to the success of the United States but there is still much work to be done to treat Asian Americans as Americans,"" said Huang. The fight against racist words and actions of certain politicians and leaders towards the Asian American community as well as long-held stereotypes is staged on a daily basis, Huang added.   Though progresses were made in the fight against discrimination in the past decades in the United States, it's surprising to see how fast setbacks took place in recent years, said Shue. The education system and literature in the United States don't talk much about the original sin of racial discrimination in U.S. history, Shue noted. Michelle Alyssa Go's death was a call to action for many, including those who see the crime Martial Simon committed as an example of ongoing anti-Asian hate, said Michelle's father Justin Go in a recent piece run by The New York Times on the anniversary of her death. Michelle Alyssa Go was shoved to her death by homeless man Martial Simon on Jan. 15, 2022 at the subway station in Times Square. It has been sad and physically exhausting to constantly hear and see the never ending strident voices spewing hatred over social media, said Justin Go.   ""Whatever freedoms we give to people, possessing such personal rights does not mean we can abandon people like Martial Simon to our subway systems,"" said Justin Go, who acknowledged progress has been made to help homeless people in New York. Everybody in the neighborhood was a little bit traumatized just from everything that went in 2022, said Brian Chin, a resident in Chinatown in Lower Manhattan. Chin is the former landlord of Korean-American woman Christina Yuna Lee, who was stalked and stabbed to death by homeless man Assamad Nash in her apartment on Feb. 13, 2022. The hate and discrimination against Asian Americans still is a problem and there still seems to be a lot of hatred, Chin told Xinhua in a recent interview. ""Hopefully, 2023 is better, but 2022 at least was a very bad year for all Asians... It seems like there's more and more hate crimes in New York City happening against Asians every week. It's a very troubling time,"" said Chin. New York Police Department (NYPD) recorded 607 hate crime complaints and made 320 arrests in 2022, higher than 524 complaints and 219 arrests in 2021, respectively, according to data compiled by NYPD.",Xinhua,2023-02-08 13:29
386,Infrastructure damage hinders earthquake aid efforts in Türkiye: UN,"   GENEVA, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- The extensive damage to infrastructure caused by the earthquakes in Türkiye and Syria is hindering aid efforts by the United Nations (UN) agencies, officials said on Tuesday. The first international disaster assessment and coordination teams had now arrived at Adana airport in Türkiye, UN officials told a press briefing in Geneva. The teams were due to move to Gaziantep, the epicenter of the first quake, on Tuesday. However, there is limited road access and a shortage of trucks to transport them to worksite. Turkish disaster authorities are therefore considering mobilizing helicopters, and trucks from other provinces farther away. A UN representative on the ground told Tuesday's press briefing via video link that so far, some 8,000 people had been rescued by search and rescue teams.   Meanwhile, the UN refugee agency UNHCR said it was providing kitchen sets, mattresses, and tents to those affected by the disaster. ""The recent earthquake is an absolute hammer blow for the people of Türkiye and displaced people in the region, notably Syrians, who had already suffered more than a decade of war and are being lashed by an economic crisis and winter storms,"" a UNHCR official said. More than 1.7 million of the 15 million people inhabiting the ten Turkish provinces most affected by the earthquakes are Syrian refugees, according to UNHCR. In some of these provinces, one in two is a refugee. Türkiye has hosted the world's largest refugee population since 2014. Around 4 million refugees and asylum-seekers are in Türkiye under temporary and international protection.   ""We do not know the exact number of refugees impacted and we might not for some days, but we fear the number might be significant given the epicenter of the quake was close to areas with high concentrations of refugees,"" the UNHCR official said. According to the latest media reports, more than 7,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands injured after massive earthquakes struck Türkiye and Syria on Monday. UN officials say the death toll is likely to continue rising. In addition, many of the buildings in the affected areas are structurally unsound, and could collapse in the coming days. The UN has announced a 25-million-U.S. dollar grant to kick-start the humanitarian response.  ",Xinhua,2023-02-08 13:32

""UNFPA is committed to support the people of Türkiye and Syria affected by the earthquakes, including the pregnant women who are expected to give birth in the coming weeks under these difficult conditions,"" said Natalia Kanem, UNFPA Executive Director. ""Their ability to access quality care before, during and after delivery must not be an afterthought."" Thousands of buildings, including UNFPA-supported maternity facilities, youth centers and women's and girls' safe spaces, have collapsed or been severely damaged. UNFPA's immediate priority is to re-establish services that are critical to the health, well-being and protection of women and girls, according to a press release. UNFPA has offices and operations in the affected areas and was immediately on the ground assessing the impacts and preparing to support the emergency response in coordination with the authorities and partners, with additional personnel on standby for deployment. Despite logistical challenges, UNFPA has already started delivering reproductive health services to earthquake survivors through existing delivery points in Türkiye and is also distributing dignity kits, containing basic hygiene items. In Syria, according to the release, blankets and warm clothes in addition to dignity kits are being provided to women and girls in need. Mobile health teams and field clinics have been deployed to provide reproductive health and protection services to affected people in the four worst-hit governorates, where women and girls' safe spaces will also be established. The provision of cash payments, which ensure women and girls can access health services and information, including for gender-based violence prevention and response, will be rapidly assessed and provided based on funding availability, according to the release. Prepositioned life-saving reproductive health supplies, including medicines to manage obstetric emergencies, will be distributed in affected areas this week, the release said.",Xinhua,2023-02-08 13:34
388,Biden delivers State of the Union address to divided Congress amid sour public mood,"  WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Joe Biden delivered his State of the Union address to Congress on Tuesday night amid a sour public mood. This is Biden's second State of the Union speech since he took office in January 2021 and the first of its kind before a divided Congress with Republicans taking control of the House of Representatives after last year's midterm elections and Democrats still running the Senate this term. The primetime remarks came a week after a Gallup poll showed that most Americans remain downbeat on the way things are going in the United States, with only 23 percent saying that they are satisfied while more than three-quarters are dissatisfied. Meanwhile, Biden's overall job performance rating continues to be underwater. According to U.S. poll tracker FiveThirtyEight, the Democrat's approval rating stood at 43.2 percent as of Tuesday, while disapproval of the job he's doing stood at 52.3 percent. More Americans are holding a negative view of his handling of the country's economy. Biden, nevertheless, devoted a swath of his speech on Tuesday to the economy, touting indicators like low unemployment and slowing inflation rates. However, inflation in the United States is still at a high level rarely seen in past history and many economists remain concerned that the U.S. economy will fall into a recession later this year. Biden also used the speech to call upon Congress to raise the debt ceiling. The federal government reached its borrowing limit last month and is trying to avoid going over the 31.4 trillion-U.S. dollar debt ceiling and defaulting on its current obligations. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who sat behind Biden during his speech to a joint session of Congress alongside U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, said on Monday that ""defaulting on our debt is not an option"" but ""a responsible debt limit increase that begins to eliminate wasteful Washington spending and puts us on a path towards a balanced budget is not only the right place to start."" International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has recently warned that a U.S. default ""would cause significant damage"" to the global economy. ""It will be very damaging for U.S. consumers if the U.S. defaults, that would push interest rates up,"" Georgieva told CBS News during an interview. ""And if people don't like inflation today, they're not going to like at all what may happen tomorrow.""",Xinhua,2023-02-08 13:39
390,"Racism, abuse of weapons fuel gun violence in U.S. society, says Egyptian expert","CAIRO, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- Heba Gamal, a member of the Egyptian Council for Foreign Affairs, has condemned frequent shooting incidents in the United States, saying they are driven by a ""deep-rooted culture of racism, bullying, white supremacy and the proliferation of arms."" ""American laws that permit 18-year-old citizens to freely and easily possess weapons, even war arms, is the main reason for exacerbating the problem,"" Gamal, also an associate professor of Comparative Politics at the Cairo-based state-run Institute of National Planning, told Xinhua in a recent interview. Violence, she said, has become part of American society and culture, with murder scenes often seen in TV series and movies. ""Amid high rates of crimes, streets have become unsafe, especially at night,"" Gamal said, adding that the rising poverty and persecution rates add more fuel to the fire. Deeming violence a deep-seated problem in the U.S. society, she said, ""Violence is part of the American culture and society,"" and those who immigrated from Europe in history assaulted the indigenous people (Native Americans). Commenting on democracy and human rights, Gamal considered them ""slogans that have not built a homogeneous community."" Targeting people of color indicated that ""racism is a well-established culture in the U.S. mentality,"" the expert said, referring to the murder of George Floyd, an African-American man, in the city of Minneapolis by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer. ""Colored people are the main victims of the American violent society,"" she said, holding the belief in white supremacy to be a major reason for the profound racism in the United States as U.S. former President Donald Trump ""supported such a concept and many groups eventually appeared to defend the rise of those racist ideas."" She said that the ""vicious circle of violence and shooting will continue,"" not only because the arms trade is a pillar of the U.S. economy, but also the existence of weapons lobbies and the spread of organized crime groups that boost violent attacks. Human rights groups have called on the U.S. Congress to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons and warned against the rising violence. ""It is a profitable trade. I do not think the Congress will pass a law on prohibiting sales of weapons for civilians,"" she said, questioning whether it is ""logical for ordinary people to own war weapons."" The repetition of violent attacks signals ""ignorance of the U.S. administration of human rights and protection of children and youth from murder,"" Gamal said. Weapon sellers are the most influential and richest people in the United States. Both Republicans and Democrats in the Congress need donors for their campaigns, and here the arms lobby plays a significant role in this process, the expert explained.",Xinhua,2023-02-08 13:40
391,Feature: Race against time to find survivors at epicenter of Türkiye's massive earthquakes,"KAHRAMANMARAS, Türkiye, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- Rescuers were racing against time and a bitter cold to find survivors in Kahramanmaras, the epicenter of two huge and deadly earthquakes that struck Türkiye and Syria on Monday. ""We have found survivors here, but also corpses. We can't abandon the search, the next hours will be crucial to find people still alive,"" Mehmet, a Turkish rescuer, told Xinhua on Tuesday. His team was searching for trapped residents under a mound of rubble that used to be the Ebrar apartment complex, flattened by two powerful tremors. Once in a while, they ask anguished people who gathered around the rubble searching for family members or volunteers to remain completely silent as they listen out for someone to call for help. Residents were asleep when a magnitude 7.7 quake jolted Kahramanmaras and several other neighboring provinces before dawn. A second earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck several hours later, complicating rescue efforts. ""The problem here is that if there are other survivors, they had to endure the cold which can cause hypothermia, and their chances of survival are getting slim,"" Mehmet noted. The rescuer explained that the complex that collapsed like a house made of cards was home to some 120 residents, most of whom are still believed to be under a mass of metal and concrete. Throughout Monday, dozens of major aftershocks rattled the region. The latest official death toll from the massive earthquakes in Türkiye stood at 5,894 with 34,810 injuries early Wednesday. Over 6,000 buildings have collapsed, but authorities believe that the actual number is much higher. Thousands of rescue workers were scattered across the vast quake-hit zone, which covers 10 provinces of Türkiye, home to around 13.5 million people. But as the quakes have also seriously disrupted the zone's infrastructure, making highways and roads inaccessible, some cities were left mostly unattended, Xinhua correspondents witnessed. Rescuers worked through the cold winter night in the hope of being able to find more survivors, but as time went by, the chance of finding people alive was diminishing. Turkish social media users were also using Twitter to relay to authorities and rescue teams the exact locations of many people who used their cell phones to locate where they were trapped underneath the buildings. Survivors of the biggest disaster that Türkiye has witnessed for nearly a century were trying to live in their cars as there was no electricity and no other buildings left to accommodate them in Kahramanmaras. But gasoline was scarce, and heating remained a serious problem, so did drinking water. In Gaziantep, Adiyaman and Malatya, three provinces hit by the quakes, survivors took shelter in community centers where they were given blankets and food, television channels reported. Mosques in the region were also opened to provide shelter. ""Because the debris removal efforts are continuing in many buildings in the earthquake zone, we do not know how high the number of dead and injured will rise,"" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Monday in a televised address in the capital Ankara. The World Health Organization warned that the death toll in the two countries could end up surpassing 20,000. The earthquake-stricken region in Türkiye is also home to hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees who have fled the civil war in their homeland.",Xinhua,2023-02-08 13:43

394,"Fury boils over persistent U.S. sanctions on war-torn, now quake-hit Syria","DAMASCUS, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- Syria on Tuesday lambasted the United States for blocking humanitarian relief work in Syria, a day after massive earthquakes rocked northern part of the country and vast swathes of its neighbor Türkiye. In a statement, the Syrian Foreign Ministry said that Syrians, while dealing with the earthquake catastrophe, are digging among rubbles with bare hands or using the simplest tools, as the equipment for removing the rubbles has been banned by the United States. Sanctions have been a main U.S. tactic toward Syria ever since the latter was listed as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1979. Since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, the United States and its Western allies have imposed a number of economic sanctions and restrictions that denied Syrians the means to pursue growth as well as access to daily necessities. U.S. sanctions intensified with the passing of the Caesar Act in 2019.  Monday's strong earthquakes drained the already limited resources of Syria, where at least 2,470 were killed and 4,650 injured, according to data released by authorities and rescuers. The city of Aleppo in northern Syria was among the hardest hit in the quake, with debris still constantly falling in the aftermath of Monday's earthquakes. And for lack of tools, some rescuers to dig through the rubble with bare hands in search of survivors in the snow and rain, Xinhua reporters witnessed. Local residents are railing against the United States for retaining the economic sanctions when Syria desperately needs help from the international community. Aisha al-Hilu, a school teacher, fled home with the kids after the earthquakes. All of their belongings were buried under the rubble. She blasted the U.S. sanctions, which have cut off Syria's economic and financial ties with the rest of the world and impeded the country's access to quake relief supplies. ""These sanctions 'punished' us, but we didn't do anything. Shame on them ... They must remove these sanctions,"" she said. Prior to the quakes, Syria was already hurt by a new round of U.S. sanctions. On Jan. 16, the Syrian Foreign Ministry condemned in a statement the United States for imposing new sanctions that hinder Syria's import of medical equipment and spare parts through ""inhuman measures."" At a press conference held Tuesday in the Syrian capital Damascus, Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) President Khaled Hboubati called for lifting the U.S. and Western sanctions on Syria to facilitate much-needed relief efforts. In an interview with the semi-official Mehr news agency on Monday, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani called on countries to pressure the United States into lifting the sanctions on Syria and the siege of the country to enable the delivery of international aid. ""The people of northern Syria are really suffering. Sanctions are stifling international relief and medical supplies. Thousands of deaths in Syria are preventible; earthquake relief should pause sanctions,"" tweeted Khaled Beydoun, associate professor of law at U.S.-based Wayne State University. ""Western countries don't need to send anything. Just remove lethal sanctions on Syria,"" tweeted Sharmine Narwani, a commentator and analyst of Middle East geopolitics and former senior associate at St. Antony's College, Oxford University.  After Monday's earthquakes, Washington has ruled out the possibility of dealing directly with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in quake relief efforts. U.S. State Department Spokesman Ned Price on Monday told reporters that the United States will send aid to Syria through non-governmental organisations (NGOs) without engaging with the Syrian government, which it does not recognize as legitimate. The accusation that Syria is a sponsor of terrorism is ""an old-school pretext"" that the United States often uses to justify its intervention in other countries, said Maher Ihsan, a journalist and political expert. ""Look at the situation now, the United States is controlling key gas and oil fields in oil-rich areas in Syria as well as key agricultural areas ... the United States didn't come here to help, but to take advantage of the situation and impose their own will,"" Ihsan told Xinhua in a previous interview. After its direct military interventions in Syria in 2014, the United States has sent troops to oil-rich regions of Syria, including the northeastern province of Hasakah and the eastern province of Deir al-Zour. Damascus has long blamed U.S. forces for stealing Syrian oil and other resources. Videos footages showing U.S. troops using tankers to transport Syrian oil to U.S. military bases in Iraq have been widely circulated online. In August last year, the Syrian oil ministry accused the United States of stealing 83 percent of Syria's oil output in the first half of 2022. The average daily output of Syrian oil in the first half of 2022 was 80,300 barrels, while the U.S. forces and their ""mercenaries"" were stealing an average of 66,000 barrels a day, a ministry statement showed. By plundering a significant percentage of Syria's oil supply, the United States has not only robbed Syria of its valuable resources direly needed for economic recovery and social construction, but also deprived average Syrians of crucial daily necessities in winter. Syrians have to endure inadequate heating and lengthy power outages during the chilly winter. ""The U.S. role in Syria has been destructive, to say the least,"" said Osama Danura, a Syrian political expert and former member of the Syrian government delegation to the Syria peace talks in Geneva. ""The economic circle in Syria has been damaged by such unilateral measures.""",Xinhua,2023-02-08 15:35

Founded in 2008, Ramunion is a professional rescue team specializing in emergency response to disasters and accidents. Its members have participated in a total of 287 international and domestic rescue missions. On Feb. 8, the first batch of 60 rescuers and two search and rescue dogs dispatched by the Blue Sky Rescue team set off for Türkiye. Founded in 2007, Blue Sky Rescue is a professional nongovernmental and independent emergency rescue team. Its members have taken part in international and domestic rescue missions.   The Shenzhen Rescue Volunteers Federation has decided to launch rescue operations in Türkiye and send an advance team to aid the rescue operation in the country. The rescue team is in contact with the Chinese Embassy in Türkiye, the Turkish Embassy in China and local overseas Chinese organizations and China-funded institutions in Türkiye to finalize their preparations for the operation. The Chinese government has launched an emergency humanitarian assistance mechanism and will provide emergency aid to quake-hit Türkiye and Syria, said Deng Boqing, deputy head of the China International Development Cooperation Agency, on Feb. 7.   China will provide the first batch of emergency aid worth 40 million yuan (about $5.89 million) to Türkiye, according to Deng, adding that China is coordinating efforts to provide relief supplies to Syria and speeding up the implementation of the ongoing food aid program. More than 5,000 people were killed after strong earthquakes jolted parts of Türkiye and neighboring Syria early Monday.  ",People's Daily Online,2023-02-08 16:02

795,"Death toll surpasses 12,000 as quake relief in Türkiye, Syria enters 3rd day","  ANKARA/DAMASCUS, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- The number of fatalities from Monday's devastating earthquakes that struck Türkiye and Syria has surpassed 12,000, as chances have become smaller to find more survivors in cold weather before the golden 72 hours are over. Rescuers and volunteers are working round the clock to locate the trapped under rubble as the survival rate without food or water drops drastically after the 72nd hour, which is rapidly approaching. Experts have warned that the 72-hour window for rescuing those trapped by the earthquakes may be much smaller than anticipated, given the low temperatures that have swept through the earthquake-hit regions will increase the risk of hypothermia. According to the latest statistics, Monday's devastating earthquakes in southern Türkiye and northern Syria have killed 9,057 people in Türkiye and 3,480 in Syria.  The search and rescue teams from more than 65 countries have arrived in the Turkish earthquake zones to offer assistance in quake-relief efforts, according to an official statement. A plane carrying a 83-member rescue team from China and 20 metric tons of disaster relief materials and equipment arrived in the city of Adana in southern Türkiye in the early hours of Wednesday. In addition to materials and equipment for search and rescue, communication and medical treatment, they also brought with them four rescue dogs. Volunteers flocked to southern Türkiye hit hard by the earthquakes. Photographs show terminals crowded with volunteers trying to help, while the roads leading to the affected areas were clogged with long queues of vehicles ready to transport supplies or offer assistance. ""It was good that we came. When we arrived, the area was rubble everywhere,"" said a volunteer who identified himself as Kerem Okyay, a businessman from the central Turkish city of Sivas who hurried to Elbistan, a town about 200 km away. Located in the southern Turksih province of Kahramanmaras, Elbistan was the epicenter of the 7.6-magnitude quake that rocked the region on Monday and close to the town of Pazarcik, the epicenter of a 7.7-magnitude one hours earlier. ""We formed a team with some friends as soon as we heard the news of the earthquake and came here as volunteers,"" Okyay told Xinhua. Soon after their arrival, the team saved two people from the debris. ""We were focusing on areas where we could hear people,"" he said. In the heavily damaged city center of Kahramanmaras, the name-sake capital of Kahramanmaras Province, sniffer dogs equipped with small GPS-enabled harnesses were leading rescuers in the search for survivors from site to site in the winter cold.    While rescue operations are taking place in Türkiye and Syria, more countries have committed to providing assistance. A Lebanese ministerial delegation headed by Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib arrived in Damascus on Wednesday to discuss with Syrian officials more possible aid for earthquake-stricken Syria. On Wednesday, Tunisia sent its third aircraft, which was packed with tonnes of emergency humanitarian aid including food, medication, blankets and clothing, to Syria. Two military planes from Tunisia were already sent to the two earthquake-stricken countries on Tuesday, carrying medical teams, rescue teams, and urgent humanitarian aid. Saudi Arabia launched on Wednesday a donation campaign to help earthquake victims in Syria and Türkiye. According to local press, a total of 25 million Saudi riyals (6.7 million U.S. dollars) had been donated to the campaign so far. Jordan announced on Wednesday that it would send aid convoys over the next few days to quake-hit areas in Syria and Türkiye, while Sudan said its Civil Defense Forces is ready to send a specialized team to Türkiye to help with rescue efforts. David Saranga, head of the Israeli aid delegation to Türkiye, said on Wednesday that two Israeli rescue teams are searching for survivors in the country, while a field hospital complete with 15 Israeli aircraft and about 230 personnel is expected to be established by Thursday or Friday, according to the Israeli military and foreign ministry.    Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan admitted on Wednesday that there were some problems in the first-day response to the earthquakes. Operations are currently back to normal, Erdogan said in Kahramanmaras Province, the state-run TRT broadcaster reported. Earthquake victims can temporarily stay in hotels in the Mediterranean tourism hub of Antalya and southern province of Mersin, he added. The Turkish president announced that each quake-stricken family would receive 10,000 Turkish liras (531 U.S. dollars), and new homes will be built in the 10 provinces affected by the disaster within a year. Also on Wednesday, Erdogan said it was impossible to get prepared for a calamity like the earthquakes that struck the country on Monday, but he vowed to exert utmost efforts to save citizens' lives. ""There are deficiencies ... It is impossible to be prepared for such a major disaster,"" Erdogan told reporters in the southern province of Hatay, which was hit hard by the earthquakes. ""We will not leave any of our citizens unattended. We will carry out disaster management by taking every necessary step so that no one will suffer,"" he said.  ",Xinhua,2023-02-09 08:14
796,Gun violence puts young Americans at risk: study,"   NEW YORK, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- Young adult males from zip codes with the most violence in Chicago and Philadelphia had a notably higher risk of firearm-related death than U.S. military personnel who served during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, according to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The study of 129,826 young adult men living in four cities -- Chicago, Philadelphia, New York City and Los Angeles -- in 2020 and 2021 found that men ages 18 to 29 in the most violent zip code of Chicago and Philadelphia faced a higher risk of firearm-related homicide than U.S. soldiers who were deployed to Afghanistan, with risk ratios of 3.23 and 1.91, respectively. The risk of violent death and injury observed in the zip codes studied was almost entirely borne by individuals from minoritized racial and ethnic groups: Black and Hispanic males represented 96.2 percent of those who were fatally shot and 97.3 percent of those who experienced nonfatal injury across the 4 settings studied. The study came as firearms surpassed motor vehicle accidents as a cause of death for children, adolescents and young adults in the United States, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The U.S. public health agency said 3,597 children died by gunfire in 2021. Overall, gun violence remained endemic in the United States in 2022, including 648 mass casualty shootings, a near-record, according to Gun Violence Archive, a website that tracks gun violence in the country. The first month of 2023 saw more than 50 mass shootings across the nation, defined as an incident in which four or more people were wounded or killed, not including the shooter.",Xinhua,2023-02-09 08:31

373,UN says 8.3 mln people require humanitarian aid in Somalia,"MOGADISHU, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- More than 8.3 million people require humanitarian assistance in Somalia where significant segments of the population are on the brink of famine, the United Nations relief agency said Wednesday. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that in the absence of adequate funding and enhanced capacity, famine is projected between April and June in the three population groups including Baidoa and Burhakaba rural districts as well as internally displaced people (IDPs) in Baidoa and Mogadishu. ""Somalis are hungrier, sicker, and more vulnerable than a year ago, pushing an ever greater number of people into reliance on humanitarian assistance for survival,"" OCHA said in its latest update on the humanitarian situation in Somalia. It said even if no famine emerges, the humanitarian situation is extremely alarming since more than 6.3 million Somalis are expected to face high levels of food insecurity between January and March, including 322,000 in catastrophic levels of food insecurity. ""The cumulative levels of excess mortality could be as high as in 2011 when almost 260,000 people lost their lives, at least half of them children. In 2022 alone, 1,049 children died in nutrition centers and many more without even accessing the centers,"" OCHA said. The crisis is caused by the historic failure of four consecutive rainy seasons, persistent conflict, displacement, and high food prices that have left millions of people at risk and are pushing people in Somalia to the brink of famine. OCHA said the current drought is the longest and most severe in recent history and has surpassed the 2010/2011 and 2016/2017 droughts in terms of duration and severity. It also said the recent escalation of the military offensive against al-Shabab, in addition to ongoing political and inter-clan tensions, has resulted in significant humanitarian impacts including increased displacement and reprisal attacks. ""Overall, it is expected that up to 450,000 additional civilians will be displaced due to conflict in 2023,"" it warned, noting that protection concerns include widespread forced family separation, indiscriminate attacks against civilians, freedom of movement restrictions, forced recruitment, abductions and destruction of civilian infrastructure. OCHA believed the ongoing military operations offer both an opportunity for expanded access into areas previously under al-Shabab control as well as the increased likelihood of widespread insecurity and acute deterioration of humanitarian access. ""This uncertainty will require partners to exercise flexibility in programming to adapt to shifting insecurity, to assess and provide assistance in newly recovered areas as well as to engage in coordinated advocacy for the protection of civilians,"" OCHA said.",Xinhua,2023-02-09 10:43
376,"Biden addresses to divided Congress amid sour public mood, low approval rating","WASHINGTON, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Joe Biden delivered his State of the Union address to Congress on Tuesday night amid a sour public mood and his low approval rating. This is Biden's second State of the Union speech since he took office in January 2021 and the first of its kind before a divided Congress, with Republicans taking control of the House of Representatives after last year's midterm elections and Democrats still running the Senate this term.  The primetime remarks came a week after a Gallup poll showed that most Americans remain downbeat on the way things are going in the United States, with only 23 percent saying that they are satisfied while more than three-quarters are dissatisfied. Besides, Biden's overall job performance rating continues to be sinking. According to U.S. poll tracker FiveThirtyEight, Biden's approval rating stood at 43.2 percent as of Tuesday, while disapproval of the job he's doing stood at 52.3 percent. More Americans are holding a negative view of the Democrat's handling of the country's economy. Biden, nevertheless, devoted a swath of his speech on Tuesday to the economy, touting indicators like low unemployment and slowing inflation rates. However, inflation in the United States is still at a high level rarely seen in past history and many economists remain concerned that the U.S. economy will fall into a recession later this year. Biden also used the speech to call upon Congress to raise the debt ceiling. The federal government reached its borrowing limit last month and is trying to avoid going over the 31.4-trillion-U.S.-dollar debt ceiling and defaulting on its current obligations. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who sat behind Biden during his speech to a joint session of Congress alongside Vice President Kamala Harris, on Monday although said ""defaulting on our debt is not an option,"" but added ""a responsible debt limit increase that begins to eliminate wasteful Washington spending and puts us on a path towards a balanced budget is not only the right place to start, it's the only place to start."" International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has recently warned that a U.S. default ""would cause significant damage"" to the global economy. ""It will be very damaging for U.S. consumers if the U.S. defaults, that would push interest rates up,"" Georgieva told CBS News during an interview. ""And if people don't like inflation today, they're not going to like at all what may happen tomorrow.""  Biden sought to set a bipartisan tone in Tuesday's address by calling for unity and cooperation between Democrats and Republicans, saying that ""fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere."" During the first two years of Biden's presidency, political discord continues to grow, with two parties seeing eye-to-eye on a string of major issues, such as abortion rights, gun violence, immigration, policing reform, climate change, and health care. Republicans -- who control the House on Capitol Hill this term -- are determined to counter Biden's and the Democratic Party's agenda, dimming the prospect of any major legislation on those issues being approved by Congress despite the president's political overtures. ""In the radical left's America, Washington taxes you and lights your hard-earned money on fire, but you get crushed with high gas prices, empty grocery shelves, and our children are taught to hate one another on account of their race,"" Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders responded when delivering the Republican rebuttal after Biden's speech. The parents of Tyre Nichols, a black man who was brutally beaten by a group of police officers in Memphis, Tennessee after a traffic stop exactly a month ago and died days later, were in attendance for Biden's address. The death of Nichols revived the painful memory of the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Floyd, also a black man, died on May 25, 2020, after an encounter with Minneapolis police, during which a white officer knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes while making an arrest with other colleagues. ""What happened to Tyre in Memphis happens too often,"" Biden said on Tuesday. ""Imagine having to worry whether your son or daughter will come home from walking down the street or playing in the park or just driving their car."" While reflecting on the suffering of Nichols, Biden asked U.S. lawmakers to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which would make it easier to prosecute police officers for misconduct but has stalled due to partisan disagreements. U.S. Congressman Jamaal Bowman, a Democrat from New York, has recently complained that tribalism in politics is preventing police reform and that people are literally dying as a result. Since the start of this year, the United States has suffered a spate of mass shootings across the country. Biden urged Congress to ""ban assault weapons once and for all"" on Tuesday but it's unlikely for Republicans -- who, in general, support gun rights and are opposed to more restrictions to carry firearms -- to come on board with the idea.  Biden's latest remarks to Congress also took place against the backdrop of Republicans-led House investigations of his alleged mishandling of classified documents and before his announcement to run for reelection. Former U.S. President Donald Trump -- who lost to Biden during the 2020 race but has refused to concede -- has already launched a third White House bid while being investigated for his dealing with classified documents. ""It must be noted how extraordinary these circumstances are: Both the current and former president are under investigation for similar causes as they prepare to run against one another next year,"" Douglas Schoen, a political consultant who served as an adviser to former U.S. President Bill Clinton, wrote in an opinion last month. ""There is now a level of uncertainty and instability that is problematic for the president, his party and indeed for our increasingly polarized and divided nation,"" Schoen underscored. In remarks directly addressing Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States Oksana Markarova, who was seated in the audience as a special guest in the House chamber on Tuesday, Biden claimed ""America is united in our support for your country."" The United States constantly funneling weapons -- of which the degree of lethality has only increased day by day -- into Ukraine since the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict nearly a year ago has met with criticism from commentators and pundits. Accusing his own government of saber-rattling, U.S. anti-war activist Jimmy Dore said recently that ""we're doing a proxy war in Ukraine, which we provoked ... We have admitted we provoked it."" ""Who is running the country? The war machine,"" Dore added.",Xinhua,2023-02-09 10:54

383,"U.S. Black, Hispanic dialysis patients at greater risk of dangerous bloodstream infections: report","   NEW YORK, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- Patients with failing kidneys who need regular dialysis treatments still have sky-high rates of dangerous staph infections in their blood compared with people who don't need these treatments, according to a new Vital Signs report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ""Rates of infection are particularly high among people who are Black or Hispanic or who have a lower socioeconomic status,"" CNN reported early this week, quoting the Vital Signs report. More than half a million Americans rely on regular dialysis treatments to filter toxins from their blood because their kidneys are no longer working as well as they should. Dialysis relies on the use of catheters and needles which circulate a patient's blood through a machine in order to clean it. ""Germs like staph can get into the patient's bloodstream via these access points,"" Debra Houry, acting principal deputy director of the CDC, said during a news briefing on Monday. ""These infections can be serious or deadly, and some are resistant to some of the most common antibiotics used to treat them."" The study shows that between 2017 and 2020, patients on hemodialysis had an annual rate of bloodstream infections caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus that was 100 times higher than adults who are not on dialysis -- 4,248 infections for every 100,000 person years compared with 42 of 100,000 person years, respectively.",Xinhua,2023-02-09 13:08
382,NATO must not be part of Russia-Ukraine conflict: German Chancellor,"   BERLIN, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- Despite providing military assistance to Ukraine, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) must not become a party to the country's conflict with Russia, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Wednesday. In a speech to the German lower house of parliament (Bundestag) ahead of a special meeting of the European Council to discuss the conflict, Scholz warned against a ""public competition to outdo each other along the lines of battle tanks, submarines, aircraft..."" This would harm the unity of the West, he said.   ""We preserve and strengthen this cohesion by preparing decisions confidentially first before communicating them,"" he said, referring to the recent decision taken by Germany and the U.S. on the delivery of battle tanks. Due to increasing pressure on Germany by NATO partners to supply heavy artillery to Ukraine, the German government decided in late January to deliver 14 Leopard 2 tanks, and to permit partners to re-export from their Leopard stocks. In addition, the export of up to 178 of the older Leopard 1 tanks was later approved. The U.S. followed suit shortly afterward, with President Joe Biden announcing the delivery of Abrams battle tanks to Ukraine.   However, experts say it will be months before the German and American tanks are delivered. Vyacheslav Volodin, chairman of Russia's lower house, warned last month that the supply of Western weapons to Ukraine would lead to retaliation with ""more powerful weapons."" Meanwhile, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated his request for more weapons, as well as fighter jets, during a visit to London on Wednesday.   The United Kingdom is Ukraine's second-largest supporter after the U.S. Last year alone, the UK provided military aid worth a total of almost 2.8 billion U.S. dollars, and the British government has already pledged to ""sustain the same level of funding in 2023."" At the upcoming European Council meeting on Feb. 9-10, Scholz indicated that sanctions against Russia would be further tightened. The bloc will support Ukraine ""for as long as necessary,"" he said.",Xinhua,2023-02-09 13:35

""We need to concentrate our human, financial and infrastructure resources on a clearly defined set of priorities,"" Putin said during a meeting of the Council for Science and Education, according to the Kremlin. Putin said that in this regard, he considers it necessary to make some amendments to the fundamental document, the National Scientific and Technological Development Strategy. According to the president, the strategy was adopted in 2016 and the situation has since changed. ""We must focus on achieving our national development goals, taking into account external pressures,"" Putin said, adding that ""this means that we must be extremely careful when selecting our scientific and technological priorities.""",Xinhua,2023-02-09 13:45
381,"Study shows Asians in U.S. California more fearful of becoming gun violence, hate crime victims","   SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- Asian residents in the U.S. state of California were much more worried about becoming victims of gun violence and hate crimes compared to other racial and ethnic groups, a report by the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research and AAPI Data said. Two-thirds of Asians, and a similar percentage of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders, said they were ""very worried"" or ""somewhat worried"" about being a victim of gun violence, significantly higher than the 43 percent average of Californians of all races, according to the report released on Tuesday. By comparison, 49 percent of Hispanic respondents, 45 percent of Black respondents, and 30 percent of white respondents said they were ""very worried"" or ""somewhat worried"" about becoming victims of gun violence, the report found. The report cited results from the 2021 California Health Interview Survey, an annual UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles) survey that interviewed more than 20,000 California households. Within the Asians, people of Korean origin reported the highest level of fear of gun violence, with 70 percent saying they were very worried or somewhat worried about it. This was followed by 66 percent of people of Filipino and Chinese origin, and 62 percent of people of Vietnamese origin, according to the report. Several factors likely contributed to Asians' higher level of fear of gun violence victimization, including reports of hate crimes and hate incidents against Asian residents during the pandemic, said Karthick Ramakrishnan, founder of AAPI Data and a professor of public policy at UC Riverside. One in four Asian Americans in California has ever experienced a hate crime or hate incident, with Southeast Asians reporting the highest levels of hate experiences at a rate of 44 percent, according to the report.   Attitudes toward reporting hate crimes to law enforcement agencies varied among Asian groups. Only one third of Asian Americans expressed being ""very comfortable"" reporting hate crimes to law enforcement. Confidence in the criminal legal system varied much more across factors such as nativity and English proficiency. Only 36 percent of U.S.-born Asian Americans agreed that justice would be served, statistically significantly lower than that of both naturalized Asian American citizens and Asian American non-citizens, the report showed. The mass shootings in schools, movie theaters, and other public settings over the last several years may have also contributed to the heightened sense of fear, Ramakrishnan said. Previous research done by AAPI Data showed that Asian Americans tended to be the strongest supporters of gun control, he added. Ramakrishnan surmised that if the same survey were conducted today, an even higher proportion of Asians would report being worried about gun violence after the two recent mass shootings in the AAPI (Asian American Pacific Islander) community in Half Moon Bay and Monterey Park. ""Gun control is an Asian American issue, it has not gotten the recognition it deserves... Asian Americans need to be part of that conversation. It also means gun control advocacy organizations need to pay attention and invest in Asian American communities,"" Ramakrishnan was quoted as saying in a report by the San Francisco Chronicle.",Xinhua,2023-02-09 13:46

801,Drug Abuse in the United States,"BEIJING, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- Drug Abuse in the United States February 2023          The challenge arisen from the use of drugs is an international one; it is most acute in the United States. Twelve percent of global drug users come from the country, three times the proportion of the U.S. population to that of the world. Based on facts and statistics, this report examines the gravity, causes and economic and social costs of drug abuse in the United States.  ◆ The U.S. National Center for Drug Abuse Statistics (NCDAS) lists eight categories of drugs most commonly used in the country: alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, fentanyl, opioids (mainly referring to psychotropic substances under control), prescription stimulants, methamphetamine and heroin. Forty-six percent of U.S. drug users report having experience using cannabis and prescription stimulants, 36 percent opioids and methamphetamine, 31 percent prescription stimulants, 15 percent heroin and 10 percent cocaine. ◆ In 2021, findings by NCDAS show about 19.4 percent of Americans have used illegal substances at least once. Out of the 280 million aged 12 and older, 31.9 million are drug users, with 11.7 percent on illegal substances and 19.4 percent either having consumed illicit drugs or misused prescription drugs in 2020. If alcohol and tobacco users are included, the number of people in the United States who are abusing substances totals 165 million. ◆ During the past 12 months, 48.2 million Americans over the age of 18 consumed cannabis at least once. Between 2018 and 2019, use of the substance increased by 15.9 percent. Though outlawed by the federal authorities, cannabis is legal in 15 states for recreational use. The cannabis industry in the country surged despite the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. When many businesses closed in March 2020 amid the pandemic, cannabis pharmacies in the eight states that legalized the substance were able to maintain their ""essential businesses"" because sales were allowed to continue during the period of mass home quarantine. As a result, legal cannabis sales in the United States hit a record 17.5 billion U.S. dollars in 2020, a 46 percent jump from that of 2019, according to BDSA, a platform providing cannabis sales data. ◆ During the past 12 months, 10.1 million Americans have consumed opium at least once. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), opioid is the primary driver of the spike in drug-related deaths. Between April 2020 and April 2021, 75,000 Americans died from opium overuse -- more than 75 percent of the total deaths from drug overdose and a 50 percent rise year on year. ◆ Each year, 95,000 people in the United States die from alcohol abuse. During the COVID-19 pandemic, over 60 percent of Americans increased their consumption of alcohol. According to the latest data, 25.8 percent of those aged 18 and older reported binge drinking in the past month, and on any given day 261 Americans would die from excessive drinking, 80 percent of whom are adults over the age of 35. ◆ Adolescents experience the fastest rise in drug overdose deaths. In this group, the 18 to 25-year-olds are the heaviest drug users, with 39 percent of them using drugs. For the 26 to 29-year-olds, it is 34 percent. Seventy percent of drug users try illicit drugs before the age of 13, and drug users as a population group is becoming younger. The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) reports that between January 2021 and June 2021, about 1,150 youngsters aged 14 to 18 died from drug overdose, a 20 percent increase from that of 2020 and more than doubling the number in 2019. In addition, 47 percent of adolescents start consuming illicit drugs upon graduation from high school.  ◆ Drug overdose exacts a high death toll on the U.S. population, greatly eroding the base of labor force and weighing on life expectancy. According to a report on the American journal Science, American death toll of drug overdose has increased exponentially over the past 38 years -- up 9 percent almost every year and doubling about every eight years. A record high of 72,000 deaths was registered in 2017. The report also shows drug abuse plagues almost all states in the United States, with only a few exceptions, i.e. South Dakota, Nebraska and Iowa. In the past decade, drug abuse deaths in the country have risen significantly; the numbers more than tripled in Delaware and New Hampshire. According to the CDC, in the year following the outbreak of the pandemic (from April 2020 to April 2021), more than 100,000 people in the United States died from drug overdose, eight times that of shooting incidents, and nearly tripling the number of deaths in traffic accidents. Between 1999 and 2017, there were more than 700,000 cumulative deaths from drug overdose in the United States. Drug overdose in the country has claimed more lives than AIDS, traffic accidents and shootings, and 70 percent of the deaths are men between the age of 25 and 54. ◆ Drug abuse engenders frequent social problems. The damage to cranial nerves caused by drug taking may aggravate anxiety and cognitive disorder, induce some mental illnesses, and cause emotion dysregulation, thus leading to problems like family discord, violent crimes, and psychological trauma in children. In addition, people caught using illegal drugs may be punished by being separated from their family and deprived of job opportunities, welfare assistance, public housing and voting rights. As a result, discrimination against drug users continues, and stigmatization will further intensify inter-generational poverty and racial discrimination. This forms a vicious cycle, which is detrimental to American society and becomes an ""American disease"" that cannot be fixed easily. As the protracted COVID-19 pandemic and growing inflation and unemployment exacerbate anxiety and the sense of isolation among people in American society, drug abuse has become increasingly severe, and the number of people addicted to drugs has soared. ◆ Drug control incurs tremendous social cost. Such cost is entailed in crime fighting, health care, productivity loss, drug education and the prevention and treatment of other social problems. Among them, fighting drug-related crimes and health care cost the most. Since 1971, the United States has spent one trillion U.S. dollars combating drug-related crimes, according to a study by the University of Pennsylvania. In 2017, the cost of drug control in the United States exceeded 270 billion U.S. dollars.  For years, the U.S. federal and state governments have vowed to vigorously tackle the drug problem, but have in fact failed to take substantive measures due to lobbying by various interest groups. Drug abuse in the United States is a reflection of deep-rooted social problems, and the result of an interplay of economic interests, lobbying, and social and cultural factors. ◆ As the U.S. economy expanded after World War II, the rapid growth in national wealth created an unprecedentedly prosperous consumer market, including an active drug trade. By the 1960s, the nationwide hippie movement and the hippie culture it generated were ubiquitous in the United States, a part of which was ""drug culture."" Under the influence of ""drug culture,"" drugs such as cannabis and heroin quickly became popular among young people. The hippie movement brought drugs to the public, and its promoters claimed that cannabis was harmless and not a narcotic drug. Apart from that, they pushed for the social acceptance of cannabis abuse on the grounds of human rights and liberty, and called for its legalization. After the late 1970s, as the public witnessed the tremendous harm that drug abuse caused to society, families and individuals, there was a convergence in American people's perception of drugs and drug control. By the mid-1980s, calls for drug legalization waned, but there was no substantive improvement in the drug problem in the United States. Since the 1990s, calls for drug legalization have risen again in the country. ◆ The U.S. government has pushed for the legalization of cannabis and other drugs out of economic considerations. Legalizing cannabis allows the government to generate significant tax revenues from the legal drug market, and in return, the distribution of such revenues becomes an important driver of drug legalization. The U.S. government has justified drug legalization to cover the fact that it would do anything for economic gains. ◆ In 2014, cannabis was legalized in Colorado. Since then, the cumulative sales of cannabis have exceeded one billion U.S. dollars. However, the number of deaths from various kinds of drug abuse in the state has reached record highs. According to The New York Times, American parents said it got much easier for teens to obtain cannabis after its legalization in Colorado, potentially seriously endangering their brain development. Some experts said in interviews that they had treated a number of patients with symptoms related to drug addiction including severe vomiting due to cannabis use, including children who intentionally or accidentally consumed cannabis. The legalization of cannabis has further boosted the black market, which in turn puts great pressure on the judicial system and threatens social security. A large number of criminal organizations grow cannabis in Colorado and then smuggle it into other states where it is illegal, making the cannabis trade more active and law enforcement more difficult. ◆ Knowing the serious social problems brought by the legalization of cannabis, the U.S. government has not responded by strengthening cannabis control, but instead further promoted drug legalization. Between its people's lives and health and economic interests, the U.S. government has chosen the latter, which is an important factor in the sustained push for drug legalization in the country. According to the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, an American think tank, one could hardly see in the National Drug Control Strategy issued by the U.S. government the important roles the government is supposed to play in fighting one of the biggest public health challenges. Instead, it has sat idle as drug and substance abuse worsens. ◆ Interest groups in America keep fanning the flame of the drug problem. In order to maintain their profits, large pharmaceutical enterprises in the United States throw a large amount of money into sponsoring experts and associations to peddle the narrative that ""opioids are harmless."" What they want is to push for drug legalization and prod pharmacies into promoting drug sales and doctors into indiscriminate prescription of drugs. As a result, some patients have unknowingly developed drug addiction that they could not get rid of. After analyzing disclosed data from the U.S. Senate, the OpenSecrets website found that the marijuana and cannabis industry, which involved more than 20 businesses, spent as much as 4.28 million U.S. dollars on lobbying in 2021 alone. In addition, Amazon paid 14.5 million U.S. dollars between April and December in 2021 for funding lobbying activities, including for the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2021 (MORE Act) which supported the legalization of cannabis. For the same purpose, the American Civil Liberties Union spent 920,000 U.S. dollars on lobbying between July and December in 2021. British American Tobacco and the Altria Group spent nearly 2.1 million and 6.6 million U.S. dollars respectively in 2021 on lobbying for the MORE Act. The House of Representatives actively considered bills that promote the legalization of marijuana and cannabis. ""We don't need to convince people to believe in cannabis. We need to convince them to buy legally,"" said Cory Rothschild, vice president of a U.S. company in the cannabis industry. ◆ The drug culture influences America's drug policies. The U.S. drug culture has been shaped by the country's development history and directly affected the adjustment and evolution of America's drug policies. Due to pressure from both work and life, many people in the United States choose to take drugs for relief or leisure. Against this backdrop, in order to prevent people from using medical treatment as a pretext for drug abuse, U.S. federal law stipulates that one must present prescription by a doctor when purchasing certain drugs. However, this policy has big loopholes in terms of supervision, and drug abuse is prevalent in the United States. Pharmacies could still sell psychotropic drugs at will. As hospital reimbursement is directly linked to patient satisfaction, many doctors are forced to prescribe psychotropic drugs. ◆ The COVID-19 pandemic has made long-existing social problems even worse in the United States, and the pressure caused by such problems as gun violence, racism, social injustice and huge wealth gap is increasingly felt by young people. The various difficulties faced by young Americans are a reflection of America's persistent social illness. On the one hand, the widening gap between the rich and poor in the United States gives young Americans more doubts about the ""American Dream"" as they could hardly see room for upward mobility. On the other hand, young people no longer feel proud of America due to intensifying social inequality, racial conflicts and other problems. A Gallup poll showed that Americans' pride in the United States hit a record low in 2020. Only 36 percent of the respondents aged 18 to 24 said they were proud to be American, while 35 percent did not express pride in being American. In December 2021, the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University published the findings of its survey, which showed that 52 percent of the respondents believed American democracy was ""in trouble"" or ""failing""; only 7 percent of young Americans viewed the United States as a ""healthy democracy""; 51 percent of the young respondents had ""felt down, depressed and hopeless"" at least a few times in the past two weeks; 25 percent of the respondents had thoughts of self-harm; and 25 percent of them believed the cause of their mental health problems was economic concerns. As young people's confidence in the United States drops dramatically and the pressure they face keeps growing, more and more of them turn to drugs to relieve their stress. ◆ The drug problem is a manifestation of America's failure in social governance. According to Howard Koh, former Assistant Secretary for Health for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, drug and substance abuse in the United States is one of the most devastating public health disasters. Apart from causing heavy burdens on the public health system, it could make millions of people lose their homes or jobs, become truant or face family breakdown. The COVID-19 pandemic masked this crisis, but in the meantime also amplified it. The crisis showcases the U.S. government's failed regulation across multiple systems, and it is imperative to make prompt, unified and comprehensive response.  The drug problem of America is a long-standing and deep-rooted disease that is yet to be cured. The U.S. government has not done enough to raise public awareness of the harm of narcotic drugs; the measures it took to reduce drug demand are ineffective; and its drug control actions produce poor results. The United States should face its own problem squarely, take actions to deal with the domestic issue of prevalent drug abuse, and protect the American people's right to life and health, instead of shying away from the problem. The fight against drugs requires, first and foremost, one's own efforts. At the same time, it also needs cooperation among all countries. The United States should stop making unwarranted accusations against China and undermining China-U.S. counter-narcotics cooperation. Even less should it mislead the public and shift its responsibility for ineffective response to drug abuse at home onto others.",Xinhua,2023-02-09 15:33

806,U.S. gunman killing 23 at El Paso Walmart pleads guilty to 90 charges,"HOUSTON, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- The gunman who killed 23 people including eight Mexicans in 2019 at a Walmart mall in the largely Latino border city of El Paso in the U.S. state of Texas pleaded guilty on Wednesday to 90 charges, including 23 counts of hate crimes resulting in death. His plea comes three years, six months and five days after the mass shooting took place on Aug. 3, 2019 as the deadliest attack targeting Hispanics in U.S. history. Patrick Crusius, then 21 years old, also admitted guilty to 23 counts of use of a firearm to commit murder in a crime of violence, 22 counts of hate crime in an attempt to kill, and 22 counts of use of a firearm during a crime of violence. ""Today's guilty plea marks one more step towards justice for the El Paso community; however, we must remember that the survivors and victims' families will be on a lifelong journey of healing because of this defendant's actions,"" Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Christopher Wray said in a statement. The shooter showed no emotion in court, and nodded his head affirmatively as federal prosecutor Ian Martinez Hanna described how the killing took place, the El Paso Times reported. Hanna said that Crusius admitted to being a white supremacist and committed the mass shooting in an effort to dissuade Mexicans and other Hispanics from coming to the United States. ""This attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas,"" Crusius wrote in a manifesto he is believed to have posted online about 20 minutes before the shooting. He had bought a semi-automatic rifle and 1,000 rounds of hollow-point ammunition online weeks ago and drove 11 hours to El Paso from his hometown Allen in northern Texas with the sole intent of killing immigrants, the indictment says. Prosecutors recommended that he receive 90 consecutive life sentences. The judge will consider sentencing in June. ""White nationalist-fueled violence has no place in our society today,"" U.S. Justice Department's Civil Rights Division Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement. ""By pleading guilty, the defendant has admitted that he murdered innocent people based on their national origin and targeted Hispanics."" The U.S. Justice Department announced last month that it would not seek the death penalty in federal charges. As a result, the maximum federal sentence the white male from Texas faces is life in prison. Crusius also faces state charges for the mass shooting. Texas prosecutors have said they plan to seek the death penalty but a trial has not been scheduled yet. A database of mass killings in the United States since 2006 compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University shows that the number of deadly mass shootings linked to hate crimes has increased in recent years across the United States, AP reported.",Xinhua,2023-02-09 15:58

804,Rescue Diary in Türkiye: Heading for quake-hit Malatya without hesitation,"My teammate from Jiangsu Blue Sky Rescue (BSR) team and I arrived at Türkiye's Adana Airport at 12:45 a.m. (Beijing Time) on Thursday, after travelling for over 30 hours. It’s the first time I had joined an international rescue operation. Though feeling somewhat nervous, I’m still confident that I can accomplish this mission, based on my related training and rich search-and-rescue experience. As I was leaving, my family told me to take care of myself and try my best to complete my tasks. I could see they worry in their eyes, but it’s my duty to extend a helping hand. Everyone is concerned about the situation in Türkiye, which now needs assistance from the international community. I promised my family that I would work and return home safe and sound.   We made many response plans during the journey, but many emergency situations arose that we did not expect following our arrival. After getting off the plane, we were informed that a quake of over five magnitude had just jolted the landing area, and the unfavorable weather conditions had made rescue work difficult. The situation in the earthquake-affected areas was complex and fluid, and we are now making detailed plans for the future work. At 3:00 a.m. local time on Feb. 9, we took on the mission to head for Malatya. Malatya is one of the hardest-hit cities in the southeast of Türkiye, and is facing a shortage of supplies and lack of international aid forces. Local Chinese volunteers and translators took the initiative to organize support for the BSR teams. There’s no time to waste. We will head for Malatya.   ",People's Daily Online,2023-02-09 17:10
805,"Int'l rescuers rush to aid quake-hit areas, as U.S. sanctions hamper relief work","ANKARA/DAMASCUS, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- A pregnant woman was loaded into an ambulance and rushed to a hospital early Thursday in Hatay, Türkiye, immediately after she was rescued from under the rubble of a collapsed eight-story building. Hatay was one of the hardest-hit areas by the massive earthquakes that jolted Türkiye and neighboring Syria on Monday. International rescuers, including those from China, are racing against time searching for signs of life among the wreckage in quake-stricken regions, as the essential 72-hour window has closed, but sanctions by the United States on Syria have obstructed coordinated efforts to save lives in the country, triggering worldwide criticism.    According to the latest statistics, the death toll from the devastating earthquakes reached 14,014 in Türkiye and 3,556 in Syria and is expected to rise further, as the 72-hour window closed on Thursday morning. More than 90 percent of earthquake survivors were rescued within the first three days, and the survival rate for those stranded without water and food drops drastically after the first 72 hours, said Gao Mengtan, a research fellow at the China Earthquake Administration. He also warned that the optimal survival window may be much smaller than anticipated, given the low temperatures that swept through the disaster zones, which will increase the risk of fatal hypothermia. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country is facing ""one of the biggest disasters of the history of the Republic of Türkiye."" On Wednesday, he visited a ""tent city"" in hard-hit Kahramanmaras where thousands of survivors were living and admitted that there were some problems in the first-day response to the deadly earthquakes. Meanwhile, Turkish volunteers flocked to the quake-hit zone to help the victims. Terminals were crowded with volunteers willing to lend a hand. Roads leading to the affected areas were clogged with vehicles transporting supplies or offering assistance. Kerem Okyay, a Turkish volunteer, drove 200 km to help the victims in Elbistan, the epicenter of a 7.6 magnitude quake. ""We formed a team of volunteers with some friends as soon as we heard the news and came here immediately,"" said Okyay, adding they have helped save two survivors from under the ruins since their arrival on Monday. ""We were focusing on areas where we could hear people,"" he said. In Syria, most of the quake-hit cities are still waiting for international aid, especially excavation equipment and medical supplies. Rescuers in Aleppo, northern Syria, have to dig through the rubble with their bare hands due to lack of rescue equipment. UN Secretary-General spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Wednesday that the road leading to the Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing from Türkiye to northern Syria was damaged, and aid delivery to the rebel-held northwest was temporarily disrupted.    International search and rescue teams, including an 82-member Chinese rescue team that arrived in Türkiye on Wednesday, rushed to the quake-impacted zone to assist in rescue efforts. The Chinese team arrived in the city of Adana in southern Türkiye in the wee hours of Wednesday with around 20 tons of relief materials and equipment. A Chinese civil rescue team and members of the Blue Sky Rescue (BSR) team, with rich experience in international rescue, also reached Türkiye, bringing rescue dogs, equipment, and other necessary resources to support their work. ""We will try our best to search for and rescue survivors,"" said Zhang Yupu, a BSR member from east China's Jiangsu Province, who had participated in the Wenchuan earthquake relief in 2008. Chinese companies are also lending a helping hand. The local branch of Chinese machinery giant Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group has deployed dozens of excavators and loaders as well as relief materials such as blankets and hygiene products to the earthquake-ravaged region. Countries across the world also sent help. Russia has sent a second rescue team with medical specialists and rescuers to Türkiye, according to the country's emergencies ministry Wednesday. More than 100 Russian rescuers have already arrived in Türkiye, and most are conducting search and rescue operations in the Kahramanmaras Province, which was the most affected by the earthquake. Tunisia has dispatched three aircraft carrying rescuers and emergency aid, including food, medication and clothing, to the two quake-stricken countries. Saudi Arabia launched a donation campaign on Wednesday to help the victims in Syria and Türkiye. A total of 25 million Saudi Riyals (6.7 million U.S. dollars) has been collected so far, according to local press. Armenia has sent 27 rescuers to the quake-hit regions of Türkiye and 29 to Syria to assist in the search-and-rescue operations, its Internal Affairs Ministry said Wednesday. Jordan, Sudan and Lebanon also announced plans to send rescue teams or aid to quake-impacted areas in Syria and Türkiye. As of Wednesday morning, 20 European Union (EU) member states and three countries participating in the EU Civil Protection Mechanism sent a total of 36 rescue and medical teams, comprised of around 1,500 personnel and 100 search and rescue dogs, said Janez Lenarcic, European commissioner for crisis management.    In Syria, where the economic situation is even worse than Türkiye, people are railing against the United States for retaining economic sanctions when Syria desperately needs help from the international community. ""These sanctions 'punished' us, but we didn't do anything. Shame on them ... They must remove these sanctions,"" Aisha al-Hilu, a school teacher in Syria's northern city of Aleppo said. She told Xinhua that she and her family fled the house without taking any belongings and are in desperate need of food and clothing in the freezing weather. Aleppo is among the cities hardest hit by Monday's megaquakes. The media office at the Aleppo governorate headquarters told Xinhua on Tuesday that the quakes killed at least 364 people, injured 702 others and toppled 52 buildings in the city. The city is also one of the most devastated by Syria's civil war. The decade-long war and Western sanctions have damaged infrastructure and impoverished millions in northern Syria, making locals more vulnerable to natural disasters. The Syrian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that U.S. sanctions are impeding rescue efforts and humanitarian assistance in Syria. As rescue equipment is banned in the country by the United States, Syrians are removing the wreckage with their bare hands and the simplest tools, the ministry said, adding that Syrians are also banned from essential medicines and medical equipment. Quake-affected Syrians are also facing a severe shortage of fuel and gas to keep warm as the winter blizzard keeps battering the disaster zone and made things there even worse.   Countries, including China, and the public are urging the United States to lift its sanctions and blockade on the Arab country to allow much-needed aid to reach the disaster zone as soon as possible. In an interview with the semi-official Mehr news agency, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani called on countries to pressure the United States into lifting the sanctions on Syria and the siege of the country to enable the delivery of international aid. ""The people of northern Syria are really suffering. Sanctions are stifling international relief and medical supplies. Thousands of deaths in Syria are preventible; earthquake relief should pause sanctions,"" tweeted Khaled Beydoun, associate professor of law at U.S.-based Wayne State University. ""Western countries don't need to send anything. Just remove lethal sanctions on Syria,"" tweeted Sharmine Narwani, a commentator and analyst of Middle East geopolitics and former senior associate at St. Antony's College, Oxford University. The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Wednesday demanded an immediate lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria as the tremor-stricken country is facing a serious humanitarian crisis. ""Even today, U.S. troops still occupy Syria's principal oil fields, plunder more than 80 percent of the country's oil production, and have smuggled and burned Syria's grain stock, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis there,"" said Mao Ning, spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry. ""In the wake of the devastating earthquakes, the United States should let go of its geopolitical obsession, immediately lift unilateral sanctions on Syria and open the door for humanitarian aid,"" Mao added.",Xinhua,2023-02-10 08:08
807,"Hopes fade for finding quake survivors as death toll surpasses 17,000 in Türkiye","   ANKARA, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- Rescue teams continued to spare no effort to search for more survivors trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings on Thursday, though hopes faded quickly on the 4th day after two massive earthquakes jolted Türkiye. The death toll from the devastating earthquakes climbed to 17,134 in Türkiye, with 71,806 injuries as of Thursday, according to Türkiye's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD). The number of casualties is expected to increase further once the search efforts are over across a wide area of 10 provinces. Experts warned that the chances of saving lives have dropped sharply after 72 hours of the quakes that hit the country on Monday.   Still, the miracles of pulling out more survivors from under the rubble of collapsed buildings over 80 hours after the quakes were encouraging. The state broadcaster TRT showed Turkish rescue teams pulling out a 60-year-old woman named Meral Nakir from the wrecks of a flattened apartment in Malatya on Thursday. The injured woman was pulled from the rubble of a six-story building with the help of a trained dog ""Kopuk."" The Golden Retriever rescue dog had served in the same site for two days and saved six people. In Antakya, Hatay, Chinese and Turkish rescuers successfully saved three women from the rubble of collapsed buildings on Thursday through their joint operations, during which two bodies of victims were also recovered.   The Turkish parliament approved the implementation of a three-month state of emergency on Thursday as called by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who said the state will use this authority to prevent malign acts of some people, such as looting, in the quake-hit regions. Speaking in southern Gaziantep, one of the quake-affected provinces, the president said containers were being provided for temporary accommodation for those who lost homes due to the quakes, while pledging to build three- or four-story buildings in one year. He also promised to allocate 10,000 Turkish liras (530 U.S. dollars) each to the quake victims. With an estimated 13.5 million people in the country affected by the massive quakes, Erdogan acknowledged there were shortcomings in the immediate response on the first day of the disaster.   A number of people have been left homeless in disaster areas. A call center was established for children whose families and relatives could not be reached in these areas. Hundreds of people from the quake-hit areas were dispatched to hospitals in other provinces. As many volunteers flocked to the quake-hit zones to help the victims, roads leading to the affected areas were clogged with vehicles carrying supplies or relief aid. International search and rescue teams, including an 82-member Chinese rescue team and several civilian teams, have arrived in Türkiye to assist in the rescue efforts.   While the official China Search and Rescue Team was carrying out rescue operations in the southern province of Hatay, members of the Blue Sky Rescue Team, a Chinese civil rescue squad, rushed to help save trapped people in the Malatya province right after their arrival in Türkiye early Thursday. Some 6,479 personnel from 56 countries have arrived in Türkiye to support the search and rescue efforts or provide humanitarian and medical aid, while rescue teams from 19 more countries will be in the country in 24 hours, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Thursday. Türkiye was rocked by a magnitude 7.7 earthquake early Monday, which was followed hours later by a second magnitude 7.6 quake, in the worst natural disaster ever seen in the country in the past decades.",Xinhua,2023-02-10 08:17
809,US urged to explain Nord Stream blasts after Pulitzer winner's probe,"Six months after the explosion of the Nord Stream gas pipelines which shocked the world, an article by veteran US investigative journalist Seymour Hersh has accused the US of being the culprit of the blasts. Washington has denied the accusations without further explanation, but the article immediately prompted a fierce verbal confrontation between the US and Russia and making waves in geopolitics. Given previous US behaviors, Chinese experts believe that the Hersh report is highly credible and Washington's denial cannot hinder Russia's determination to dig out more evidence from the report's value as a clue. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Wednesday urged the US to give an explanation over its role in 2022 explosion of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. ""The White House must now comment on all these facts,"" Zakharova said in a post on her Telegram page. In response, White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said on Wednesday that the investigative article was ""utterly false and complete fiction,"" and the CIA and Pentagon also dismissed the allegation with similar rhetoric, according to media reports. Hersh, an 85-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner, published the article on his personal website on Wednesday, stating the US military involvement of sabotaging the Nord Stream gas pipelines after senior White House officials' nine-month long plot inside the national security community. Citing sources with direct knowledge of the plot, the article revealed many details of the operation: Explosives were planted by US Navy divers under the cover of the NATO maritime exercise; and a surveillance plane of NATO member Norway triggered the explosives on September 26, 2022 after US President Joe Biden greenlighted the operation. Although there's no final verdict on who was responsible, the US, NATO, as well as investigators from Sweden and Denmark agreed it was ""a result of sabotage.""  Some US media had blamed Russia as the likely culprit soon after the Nord Stream explosion in September 2022, but Hersh wrote that political elites from his country has more incentives to destroy the pipeline regarding their words prior to the incident. On February 7, 2022, US President Joe Biden threatened that ""if Russian tanks or troops cross the border of Ukraine, there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2."" At a press conference in September 2022 about the consequences of the worsening energy crisis in Western Europe, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken suggested halting Nord Stream is a ""tremendous opportunity to once and for all remove the dependence on Russian energy"" and stop Russia from ""weaponizing energy"" for political purposes. If Biden were an ordinary citizen, and a tube explosion had happened somewhere in the US after Biden made those threats, his words would have been interpreted by the US procurator as a strong motive, and Biden would bear legal liability,Lü Xiang, an expert on US studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday. Hersh proved his credibility in his investigations on the 1969 massacre of Vietnamese civilians by US forces and US troops brutalizing Iraqi prisoners after the US invasion in 2003, which prompted Lü to believe in his latest investigation of the North Stream pipeline explosion. ""Even if it's not 100 percent accurate - exposure of such shady activity can hardly be 100 percent accurate - it's definitely not made up out of nowhere,"" Lü noted. As of press time, US mainstream media including The New York Times and The Washington Post maintained silence on the matter, which is qualified to be top on a US newspaper's front page. Lü suspected the consistent silence was a sound coordination between the US media and the US government, and the strategy is to deny it and wipe it from news portals even if their smoking gun was caught. Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Thursday that as the US had used washing powder to accuse Iraq of possessing weapons of mass destruction, it's a genius of playing dirty. Hersh's courage should be praised, yet analysts expressed concerns about his safety. It is obvious that the US benefited most from the destroyed pipelines. ""If the US was behind the sabotage, definitely the Americans would have carefully planned how to destroy or hide the evidence and mislead the public,"" Li said. Lü said that without an entity in legal sense to be in charge of such international disputes, it is almost impossible to establish a legal fact even if more evidence further support the point that the US was the culprit. But this investigative report will strengthen Russia's determination to dig out more evidence, he said. Reactions to the blasts by some Western leaders also added to suspicion of US, including then British Prime Minister Liz Truss' texting ""it's done"" to Blinken and former Polish foreign minister's tweet ""Thank you, USA."" In January 2023, Russia blamed that Sweden and Denmark, who were investigating holes in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, ""have something to hide"" and blocked Russia from engaging in the joint investigation. ""Whether or not the US is the culprit, Europe has acted too obedient. It is also tragic that as the Russia-Ukraine conflict intensifies, Europe has less and less room to bargain with US on security issues,"" Li said. European politicians should reflect on whether blindly following the US would ultimately benefit Europe, or just the opposite, the expert said. He urged Europe to effectively strengthen autonomy. ""Otherwise incidents like the Nord Steam pipeline blasts could happen again, and the price will again be paid by Europe, not the US.""",By Wang Qi (Global Times) ,2023-02-10 08:23
366,US will never win competition with China through dirty tricks: China Daily editorial,"  In his State of the Union Address on Tuesday, US President Joe Biden reiterated that the United States seeks competition not conflict with China. Although that makes his administration's China policy appear more focused and balanced than the administration's earlier clarion call based on competition, cooperation and confrontation, it is fundamentally unchanged. For that reason, the US' competition with China is essentially different from that with other countries, including its allies. The latter is for economic benefits, while the former is aimed at the containment of China. While the Biden administration claims that it does not seek to change China's system, it is not because it doesn't want to, but because it has failed to achieve that. Likewise, the Biden administration's stance of not seeking conflict with China is because it has realized that conflict with China will definitely not leave the US unscathed. Meanwhile, given the size of China and its close connections with the world economy, it would be extremely difficult for it to maintain the stability of its socioeconomic life, if the US succeeded with its attempts to decouple China from the rest of the world, particularly before it realizes self-reliance on key resources and technologies. The Chinese side will by no means be hoodwinked by the word play of the Biden administration, which is in fact for domestic consumption rather than reflecting any real changes in its approach toward China. His call that the nation should unite to win the competition with China was essentially in line with the rest of his speech in which he attempted to extend an olive branch to the Republicans. Taking a tough line on China is one of the few things on which the two parties see eye to eye, and Biden is clearly hoping to leverage that to get support from the Republicans for other parts of his agenda. ""Winning the competition with China should unite all of us,"" he declared, getting to the nub of the problem: ""For the last few years our democracy has been threatened, attacked, and put at risk."" — threats and attacks that come, not from China or other countries, but from the intensifying feuding within the US itself, both its political system and society. The purpose of true competition is to bring out the best of the competitors. It is not China that is trampling rough-shod over the rules-based international order, but the US with its tariffs, sanctions, clique building and proxy wars. China is always open to cooperation with the US. And it is also open to competition that is based on the principles of mutual respect, fairness and justice, not long-arm jurisdiction and coercion. Any competition that resorts to such dirty tricks is merely a form of conflict.",Chinadaily.com.cn,2023-02-10 08:42
365,UN to launch flash appeal for donor support for quake-hit Syria,"  UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday announced that the world body will launch a flash appeal for donor support for those affected by the earthquake in Syria next week. ""The earthquake that struck Trkiye and Syria is one of the biggest natural disasters in our times,"" Guterres told reporters, warning that ""we haven't yet seen the full extent of the damage and of the humanitarian crisis unfolding before our eyes."" He pointed out that the earthquake struck as the humanitarian crisis in northwest Syria was already worsening, with needs at their highest level since the conflict began. Guterres said that the first UN convoy, which included six trucks carrying shelter and other desperately needed relief supplies, crossed into northern Syria Thursday through the Bab al-Hawa crossing on the border with Trkiye. ""More help is on the way, but much more, much more is needed,"" he said, adding that the United Nations has done its best to race to respond and are committed to doing much more. The UN's Central Emergency Response Fund has released 25 million U.S. dollars to jumpstart the response. ""By early next week, we will launch a flash appeal for donor support for those affected by the earthquake in Syria,"" Guterres said, adding that the United Nations is also ready to support the Turkish government's response ""in any way we can."" Guterres said he has asked UN Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths to travel to areas affected by the earthquake this weekend. Griffiths, already in Trkiye, will also visit Aleppo and Damascus in Syria to assess needs and see how the United Nations can step up support. In addition to more resources, Guterres stressed the need ""to explore all possible avenues to get aid and personnel into all affected areas."" ""This is the moment of unity, not to politicize or to divide, but it is obvious that we need massive support,"" he told reporters. ""I would be very happy if in relation to the UN, there will be the possibility to do it also in as many crossings as possible."" ""This is a moment in which everybody must make very clear that no sanctions of any kind interfere with relief to the population of Syria in the present moment,"" he said. Devastating earthquakes struck Trkiye and Syria on Monday, leaving nearly 20,000 people dead in the two countries so far, according to latest data.    ",Xinhua,2023-02-10 08:57
364,Democrats submit resolution to expel Republican lawmaker George Santos from U.S. Congress,"   WASHINGTON, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- A group of House Democrats filed a resolution on Thursday, seeking to expel Republican lawmaker George Santos from the U.S. Congress. ""We gave him plenty of time to resign, and he has chosen not to do so,"" U.S. Congressman Robert Garcia, a California Democrat, told reporters. Santos, the U.S. representative for New York's 3rd congressional district, has admitted to fabricating several aspects of his work history and education, following his election last year. The embattled Republican freshman is facing several investigations but has refused to step down. The resolution is largely symbolic and unlikely to reach the floor for a vote as House Republican leaders have so far declined to call on Santos to resign. Santos and U.S. Senator Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, had a tense exchange shortly before U.S. President Joe Biden's State of the Union address on Tuesday night. Romney later revealed that he told Santos that he did not belong there. Santos said on Wednesday that he thought Romney's comments were ""reprehensible.""

367,Suffering of Syria caused by US further exacerbated by devastating earthquake: ambassador,"The death toll from the devastating earthquake that hit Turkey and Syria is continuing to climb. In an exclusive interview with the Global Times, Mohammed Hasanein Khaddam, Syrian Ambassador to China, said that the roots of Syria's suffering - the US' long-arm jurisdiction - are further exacerbated by the disaster. The US long-arm jurisdiction wears political glasses, and targets ""non-malleable"" countries. Even in this shocking humanitarian calamity they failed to depoliticize their attitude, Khaddam said. The US sanctions ""tightened the noose"" around the Syrian economy, and split the Syrian banks from the international financial system, so that you cannot trade with other countries and are even unable to buy medication and survival equipment, Khaddam told the Global Times on Thursday. Syria has faced US sanctions since 1979, which have got worse since then. This has been their convoluted diplomacy in the Middle East that ""succeeded"" in keeping the crisis alive for decades, the envoy said. ""No wonder it has lost its credibility in the region even with its friends there."" Unfortunately, the situation is really difficult and painful amid the earthquake, and the Syrian government mobilized all available resources for the afflicted areas, but the catastrophe is widespread, Khaddam said. ""Many people are still under the rubble,"" he said. Buildings and infrastructure have been hit hard. Tens of thousands became homeless because large numbers of buildings are dilapidated and uninhabitable due to the first quake and the aftershocks, so the number of deaths is in the thousands and on the rise, with hospitals and medical centers overstretched. The Syrian government issued on the first day of the catastrophe an appeal calling on all countries, international organizations and funds, and governmental and non-governmental organizations to extend emergency assistance, especially search and rescue machinery and equipment, the ambassador said. ""The first priority is saving, then curing, sheltering and providing survivability means. Of course we feel deeply touched and grateful to all countries that sent condolences and provided or offered assistance."" Fresh snowfall in Syria on Wednesday has compounded the already desperate situation faced by millions of people whose lives have been affected by the earthquake disaster, said the UN's top humanitarian official in the country. On Wednesday, China urged the US to put aside its geopolitical obsession and immediately lift unilateral sanctions on Syria since Washington's long-term involvement in the Syrian crisis with military intervention and economic sanctions has resulted in a large number of civilian casualties and difficulties in economic development and the reconstruction process in the country. The US should open the door to humanitarian aid in face of the catastrophe, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. Throughout the Syrian war, the US nourished and fostered terrorist groups and used them as tools to destroy Syria. The US has also been stealing Syrian oil and agricultural products, which incurred losses totaling more than $110 billion, in addition to imposing a blockade to suffocate the economy, the envoy said. ""This, no doubt, shows the roots of our suffering which is further exacerbated by the earthquake. These sanctions are deadly under the 'rule-based order',"" he said. In terms of the quick response, many aid agencies in China, both governmental and nongovernmental, announced their intention to provide Syria generously with much-needed aid, the envoy said. ""There are now rescue teams from China on the ground. We also received many heartily compassionate messages and calls of support from the Chinese people, which are deeply overwhelming,"" he said. ""Many Chinese friends answered our call of appeal; many even came to the embassy to offer their compassion, which was truly touching."" The Red Cross Society of China sent the first batch of medical supplies, which will meet the needs of 5,000 people, to the earthquake-stricken area in Syria from Beijing on Thursday morning, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Thursday. Besides the cash and material assistance already announced, China is also speeding up the implementation of food aid programs to Syria, with 220 tons of wheat on the way to Syria and the remaining 3,000 tons of rice and wheat to be shipped in two batches in the near future, the ministry said. ""We feel inundated with compassion, and cannot thank enough these feelings and prompt responses at the official level and from the people, which mirrors the humane soul of the Chinese civilization,"" Khaddam said.",By Chen Qingqing and Bai Yunyi (Global Times) ,2023-02-10 09:35

The death toll from Monday's devastating earthquake in Trkiye has risen to 14,014, with other 63,794 injured so far, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday.  A state of emergency decision for 10 quake-affected provinces will take effect after voted today at the parliament as of Thursday afternoon, Erdogan told reporters when visiting the southern Gaziantep province where he inspected the emergency response.

""These early racial and ethnic disparities in vaccination rates led many news stories, journal articles and other reports to perpetuate a narrative that disparities in the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines among people of color were largely driven by vaccine hesitancy, while neglecting to focus on health inequities and other factors as drivers of disparities in vaccine intentions and uptake,"" said the report. The COVID-19 pandemic has re-illuminated how racism and social and structural inequities in this country negatively influence health outcomes among people of color, laid bare by their disproportionate burden of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths, according to the report. Use of the term vaccine hesitancy in the context of COVID-19 vaccines might be perceived as placing responsibility for vaccination status on the individual, leaving historical and current social and structural inequities that affect vaccine confidence and vaccination rates unexamined and unaddressed, it said. ""The failure of the media and scientific scholars to contextualize how inequities affect vaccine intentions and uptake among people of color during a critical period when there was a defined goal for adult COVID-19 vaccination in the USA reveals missed opportunities to change the narrative from hesitancy and refusal toward racism and inequities that affect vaccine intentions and uptake,"" it added.",Xinhua,2023-02-10 13:17

""The new estimate -- computed by Larry D. Turner, the inspector general of the Labor Department -- galvanized House Republicans as they intensified their scrutiny of the roughly 5 trillion dollars in emergency funds approved since the start of the crisis,"" reported The Washington Post. Opening the inquiry, Smith described the problems plaguing unemployment insurance as the ""greatest theft of taxpayer dollars in American history."" The money helped rescue the economy from the worst crisis since the Great Depression, but ""it also invited an unprecedented wave of theft and abuse, as criminals seized on the government's generosity -- and its race to disburse aid -- to bilk state and federal agencies for massive sums,"" said the report. Top watchdogs told the House Ways and Means Committee that they still cannot compute the total amount of federal COVID aid subject to fraud and abuse, but Turner's testimony noted that the country's misspending on unemployment benefits, in particular, may be far greater than previously known, it added.",Xinhua,2023-02-10 13:28

The book, whose original Spanish title is ""Observando el arroz crecer,"" contains 88 short stories or articles that aim to inform readers about Chinese culture, and help them understand the country and the way its people think. Ceballos is an expert in internationalization, market strategy and negotiation, who lived and worked in China for 17 years. He said that ""the truth is that today China knows the West much better than we know China."" The writer believes ""there is a need for more Western people with knowledge of Chinese reality.

In his opinion, there is a ""very simple"" reason why people need this understanding: ""China is already the largest exporter in the world."" The West, he said, is ""still trapped in echo chambers that only reinforce the preconceived ideas (and not always correct) that we have of almost everything Chinese.""

Raisi made the remarks in a meeting with foreign ambassadors and heads of foreign missions in Tehran on the occasion of the upcoming 44th anniversary of the victory of Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, which falls on Feb. 11, according to the website of the Iranian president's office.

Turning to the talks on the revival of the 2015 nuclear deal, Raisi said that Iran has, since months ago, expressed its readiness to finalize the negotiations and achieving a ""good and fair agreement"" and has shown its goodwill to this end, despite the Western sides' failure to honor their commitments. Iran signed the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), with world powers in July 2015, agreeing to put some curbs on its nuclear program in return for the removal of the sanctions on the country. The U.S., however, pulled out of the deal in May 2018 and reimposed its unilateral sanctions on Iran, prompting the latter to reduce some of its nuclear commitments under the deal. The talks on the JCPOA's revival began in April 2021 in Vienna, Austria. No breakthrough has been achieved after the latest round of talks held in August 2022.",Xinhua,2023-02-10 14:02

Rescuers from countries including Japan, South Korea, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are depicted, but Chinese rescuers are noticeably absent. There is no reason to criticize CNN for leaving out Chinese rescue workers from their report on the worldwide rescue squad, as it is reasonable to assume that the network could not include all countries in its coverage. However, on the same day, CNN published a photo shot by Reuters showing a Chinese rescuer looking on as his colleagues searched amid the rubble. The words ""China Search and Rescue"" were barely legible in English but noticeable in Chinese on his jacket. Unlike his international colleagues, the Chinese man in the backdrop of this photo receives no mention in the caption.   When it comes to reporting on China, Western media tends to exaggerate and twist anything ""Chinese"" so that it can be used to criticize the country. Furthermore, crucial details that could help foreigners get a better understanding of the country are routinely covered up. Over the past few days, western media outlets have produced countless pieces highlighting rescue operations from countries like the US in Türkiye while ignoring the fact that US sanctions are the main reason international rescue personnel have encountered problems reaching Syria, another country that was affected severely by the earthquake. Some western media outlets have prioritized their political bias, excluding countries like China from their coverage rather than fostering global cooperation at this crucial moment.    China has been sending rescue workers and other supplies to Türkiye since the earthquake struck the country. By Thursday, the Chinese government had dispatched 82 rescue experts to Türkiye, while 12 non-governmental rescue teams, numbering 250 individuals in total, had also arrived in the country to aid with rescue efforts. The Chinese government's expert rescue crew has pulled at least three people, including a pregnant woman, from the debris in just two days. China has announced it will provide 40 million yuan ($5.9 million) in emergency aid to Türkiye and 30 million yuan to Syria. China’s Ministry of Commerce is preparing disaster relief materials urgently needed in Türkiye and Syria and arranging transportation, said Shu Jueting, a ministry spokeswoman, at a news conference on Thursday. ""We will strive to transport the materials to the affected areas as soon as possible."" Shu said the ministry is also accelerating the implementation of an ongoing food aid program to Syria. About 220 metric tons of wheat have been sent to the country and more than 3,000 tons of wheat and rice will be shipped very soon, she said.       ",People's Daily Online,2023-02-10 15:58
362,Rescue Diary in Türkiye: Chinese rescuers receive donuts from locals at quake ruins in Türkiye,"""Chinese rescuers have been warmly welcomed by local people in the quake-hit city of Malatya, Türkiye, and the locals have brought us donuts to express their gratitude,"" Zhang Yunlu, one of the Chinese rescuers in Türkiye and head of China's Blue Sky Rescue team in Yangzhou city, east China's Jiangsu Province, told People's Daily Online. Zhang arrived at the earthquake-stricken area at around 10 a.m. on Feb. 9 local time, and was shocked by what he saw in the devastated city. ""There were ruins as far as the eye could see,"" he said. The temperature in Malatya city is still low, dropping to below zero degrees Celsius at midday, according to Zhang. The roads at the damaged areas are frozen and slippery, and many buildings have collapsed in the disaster, he said.   ""Rubble is everywhere. Pieces of rubble lie on top of each other and are covered with snow, which makes rescue work more difficult,"" he told People's Daily Online. ""Our top priority is to search for signs of life,"" Zhang said, adding that rescuers work in groups, with each group being responsible for a specific type of task. Zhang's group is responsible for communication between different sites for the supply of materials and the transfer of personnel. ""As soon as a sign of life is detected, we need to immediately send the appropriate machinery and rescue personnel to the spot where the survivor is, so as to ensure the rescue operation can be carried out smoothly,"" Zhang said. Local overseas Chinese and warm-hearted volunteers have provided great support for the rescuers, according to Zhang, who revealed that they have made thoughtful preparations for work handover, and also prepared living supplies for them, including drinking water and bread. ""The transnational rescue operation is touching, heart-warming, and heart-shaking,"" Zhang said.",People's Daily Online,2023-02-10 16:55
816,International cooperation helps rescue efforts in Türkiye,"  The first squad from China’s Blue Sky Rescue (BSR) team was the first international assistance force to enter Malatya, Türkiye, arriving at the camp there on Feb. 9 local time. The squad was divided into seven groups, equipped with life detectors and other rescue facilities, and rushed to different work sites. The dispatched team had kept close contact with the Turkish Embassy in China and Türkiye's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) before leaving, according to He Qingrong, liaison officer of the international department of the BSR. He said that they also learned that the volunteer forces there are composed of local Chinese, Turks who had studied in China and Chinese students from the Confucius Institute. “Before our first team arrived, a 30-member translation group had already been waiting at the airport for a day,” He added. With the help of local volunteers, we efficiently overcame any language difficulties. “It’s the first time that we completely addressed problems caused by language. Once they are smoothly handled, all other issues will be much easier. As soon as we reached the rescue site, we got a full picture of what was going on here in just ten minutes,” He said. The BSR team will continue the rescue work over the next dozen days, the liaison officer noted. The second group of BSR team members is expected to depart on Feb. 11 (Beijing Time).",People's Daily Online,2023-02-10 17:54
818,Chinese aid plane arrives in quake-hit Syria with medical supplies,"  DAMASCUS, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) -- A plane carrying emergency medical supplies from China arrived Thursday in Syria to help the country in the aftermath of a deadly earthquake. The plane, belonging to the Red Cross Society of China (RCSC), landed at the Damascus international airport Thursday evening. The Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) received the shipment at the airport with Chinese Ambassador Shi Hongwei present. Shi expressed confidence that Syria will overcome the catastrophic impact of the quake, saying that China stands with Syria in dealing with the disaster. On Thursday evening, Syria's Health Minister Hassan al-Ghabbash said the death toll from the earthquake rose to 1,347 and the number of injured to 2,295. The minister called on the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and other international organizations to provide assistance to Syria to deal with the disaster. After strong earthquakes jolted Türkiye and Syria on Monday, the RCSC has provided the Turkish Red Crescent and the Syrian Red Crescent with 200,000 U.S. dollars in cash respectively as emergency humanitarian assistance. The RCSC said it will remain updated on the humanitarian needs in the disaster-stricken areas of the two countries and pledged to offer humanitarian aid to the best of its ability.",Xinhua,2023-02-11 10:05
819,"EU leaders fail to agree on Ukraine, migration policy at extraordinary summit","   ROME, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) -- An extraordinary European Council summit convened in Brussels to discuss Ukraine, economic policy and migration wrapped up on Friday with unresolved differences among leaders over key issues. Although there was some agreement on continued European support to Ukraine in its conflict with Russia, opinions diverged on immigration policy and on specifics related to Ukraine's candidacy for European Union (EU) membership. During a visit by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to the two-day summit, he called for more economic and military aid for his country. Heads of state and government agreed to do whatever it takes to support Ukraine, but many of the details of what this will mean still need to be hammered out. Leaders also failed to agree on a timetable for Ukraine's accession to the EU as Zelensky had hoped.   Moreover, even the terms on Ukraine that have been agreed have caused some divisions. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on Friday criticized France's President Emmanuel Macron for organizing a closed-door meeting that included Zelensky and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, but excluded leaders of other EU member states. Meloni said that the ""inappropriate"" discussions between the Ukrainian leader, and the leaders of the EU's two largest economies ""threatened the unity"" of the 27-nation bloc in confronting the crisis in Ukraine. ""I think our strength in this fight is unity,"" Meloni said, after meeting privately with Zelensky on the sidelines of the summit. Last year, Macron and Scholz worked closely with Mario Draghi, Meloni's predecessor. Meanwhile, Bulgarian president Rumen Radev called for peace in Ukraine.   Speaking before Zelensky's arrival at the summit, Radev said that sending more military aid to the conflict was like ""putting out fire with gasoline."" He added that ""one year after the start of"" this conflict, it was now time to move the focus onto measures to stop it, and ""diplomatic efforts in search of a peaceful solution."" Regarding migration, Meloni declared a victory as leaders agreed that they must take shared responsibility and share the cost of a widening migration crisis, a key issue for Italy. ""A new principle was established,"" Meloni said. ""It now says, in black and white, a sentence that it had never been possible to write down before: 'immigration is an EU problem and needs an EU response.'""   Nevertheless, certain specifics still need clarifying in terms of a united EU response, and it is not clear when these will be addressed. Elsewhere, France and Germany pushed for a united response in combating the effects of the economic subsidy package in the United States, dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act. The two countries said the plan gave U.S. companies an unfair advantage over European rivals. However, although the issue was discussed in depth at the summit, there was no conclusion on a response. The European Council is made up of heads of state or government from the 27 EU member states.",Xinhua,2023-02-11 10:10

On the stretcher was a pregnant woman who had just been rescued from a collapsed house. It was not until the pregnant woman was sent to the ambulance that the rescuers were slightly relieved. They patted their colleagues on the back, sharing joy and encouraging each other. The woman was found by Turkish rescuers in the ruins of an eight-story building in Antakya, a city in Hatay Province, one of the country's worst-hit regions, at around 6:00 p.m. local time (1500 GMT) Wednesday, said Zhao Yang, deputy leader of the Chinese rescue team. Zhao and his teammates rushed to the scene after local rescuers contacted them. Upon arrival, they assessed the situation and then made a rescue plan with their Turkish partners. The Chinese team also gave professional advice and provided technical equipment during the rescue operation, Zhao told reporter. The team landed at the Adana international airport on Wednesday and arrived in Antakya after an 8,000-km flight and hours of road trip. With no time to rest, they immediately joined the rescue operation.   Later on Thursday, two more survivors were plucked to safety from the ruins of collapsed buildings beyond the critical 72 hours for rescue by Chinese and Turkish rescue teams. The first young woman was got out from the ruins of a seven-story building. She was covered with blankets provided by the rescue team, wearing neck guards and looking pale. The rescue team carefully carried her into an ambulance and sent her to hospital for treatment. In the evening, another woman was found in a basement. After unremitting efforts, the rescue team carried her out. Rescuers covered her with a special thermal film, before carefully carrying her to an ambulance.

On Thursday, the U.S. Treasury Department issued a so-called six-month sanctions exemption for Syria-bound humanitarian aid, saying the U.S. sanctions in Syria ""will not stand in the way"" of live-saving efforts. The Syrian ministry responded in the statement that the U.S. decision ""stipulates alleged exemptions for humanitarian purposes, and the facts on the ground proved its falsehood.""

The Syrian government has repeatedly said that the sanctions were unjust and targeted the livelihoods and the well-being of the Syrian people, particularly after the earthquake that hit the country on Monday.

Since then, XBB.1.5 has been spreading quickly in the United States. XBB.1.5 is currently the most transmissible variant in the country.

In some regions, ""police are a questionable solution to the problem of gun violence,"" it said.

313,"China rushes rescue teams to quake-hit Türkiye, Syria","BEIJING, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- China has offered an array of rescue teams and vital items to Türkiye and Syria since massive earthquakes and aftershocks jolted the countries on Monday, in an effort to help search for survivors trapped under the rubble. Türkiye's disaster management agency updated the country's death toll late Friday from the earthquakes to 20,213, bringing the total fatalities with neighboring Syria to over 23,000, with tens of thousands injured. International aid is pouring in amid ongoing rescue efforts. Here's a look at the Chinese rescue teams performing rescue missions in Türkiye and Syria: An 82-member Chinese rescue team arrived at Türkiye's Adana Sakirpasa Airport on Wednesday morning, carrying over 20 tons of equipment for rescue, communication and medical purposes, and four rescue dogs. After driving for hours, the team arrived in the southern Turkish province of Hatay near the epicenter and carried out search and rescue operations in two areas as arranged by the local authorities. Having saved a trapped pregnant woman on Thursday, the Chinese rescuers, with their Turkish colleagues, later pulled out two survivors from the ruins in Antakya, a city in Hatay. On Friday, following a three-hour effort, a woman, the fourth survivor saved by Chinese rescuers, was pulled out to safety from the rubble of collapsed buildings over 96 hours after the earthquake. The Chinese team was called to the scene after their Turkish counterparts discovered signs of life when clearing a heap of building ruins. During the operation, the team squeezed a flexible endoscope camera through small gaps in rubble to survey the condition beneath and worked with Turkish rescuers to demolish the surface of buried areas. The Red Cross Society of China (RCSC) dispatched on Thursday morning a team of rescuers, with its first batch of medical supplies, to assist earthquake relief in war-torn Syria. At the request of the Syrian Embassy and the Syrian Red Crescent, the RCSC sent supplies for up to 5,000 people. Several civil Chinese rescue teams also joined the rescue efforts. Eight earthquake relief experts from China's Rescue Team of Ramunion arrived in Türkiye on Wednesday from the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, with more personnel from the rescue union expected to arrive in the coming days. Captain of the team He Jun said that they would use advanced radar life detectors, demolition and rescue equipment and a search dog for the mission. Members from the Blue Sky Rescue Team, a Chinese civil relief squad, started to assist rescue operations in Malatya province after their arrival on early Thursday, bringing search dogs, emergency items and other necessary resources. After dozens of hours of working around the clock, an elder woman was successfully rescued by the civil relief squad. The Amity Foundation, a Chinese non-governmental organization, also sent a team of around 60 members to Türkiye. The team carried out rescue work and provided aid for quake-affected people, such as distributing clothes and food, improving sanitation, etc. As of Friday morning, 15 civil Chinese rescue teams comprising 288 personnel had made it to quake-hit regions in Türkiye. It has been 100 hours since the disaster occurred, and the local temperature remains low, casualty numbers are likely to rise as search-and-rescue efforts span a wide area of 10 Turkish provinces.

315,Sanctions removal contradicts U.S. previous claims of not targeting humanitarian effort -- experts,"DAMASCUS, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. decision to lift sanctions on Syria in the wake of international condemnation contradicts what it has claimed, namely that the sanctions did not target humanitarian aid to the quake-hit country, Syrian experts have said. The U.S. Treasury Department issued a six-month sanctions exemption for Syria-bound humanitarian aid on Thursday, three days after massive earthquakes and aftershocks struck Türkiye and neighboring Syria that have left more than 24,000 dead and tens of thousands injured in both countries. ""The announcement of the U.S. Treasury is a confession that what Washington was claiming that the sanctions did not affect humanitarian aid was a false and misleading claim,"" political expert Muhammad al-Omari said. Political expert Kamal al-Jafa said that if Washington's previous claims were legitimate and convincing, it would not have decided to lift the embargo. ""The United States knows that the sanctions imposed on the Syrian people were unjust and led to worsening the living conditions of the Syrians over the past few years,"" he said. The Syrian government has repeatedly urged Washington to remove sanctions as they were unjust and inhumane, particularly after the strong earthquakes. On Tuesday, it lambasted the United States for blocking humanitarian relief work in Syria. Sanctions have been a main U.S. tactic toward Syria ever since the latter was listed as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1979. Since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, the United States and its Western allies have imposed a number of economic sanctions and restrictions that denied Syrians the means to pursue growth as well as access to daily necessities.

At the Nazlet Maysalound neighborhood in Aleppo and the nearby areas, the government safety committees have examined the seriously damaged buildings following the earthquake that rocked the country on Monday, and have decided to demolish eight buildings already. On Saturday Xinhua team visited the site and witnessed the demolition of a cracked building. Workers were knocking out some walls in the six-story building and opening holes in some corners to secure a smooth demolishing of the building. A big bulldozer started knocking down some of the walls while workers started wrapping thick metal cords around some of the pillars to pull them back and make the building fall. A hundred meters away, a cordon formed by military personnel and firefighters prevented people from inching close to the dangerous building. Residents, standing in pain, watching their memories and entire lifetime going down. Jamil al-Muhammad, a man in his 20s, said that the second and fifth floors belonged to his family. ""We were sitting in peace when the earthquake hit, and we had to flee. Public Safety came and examined the building and marked the building as uninhabitable. So, it's being destroyed today,"" he lamented. They survived the 11-year-long war, but the earthquake finally displaced them from their homes, he told Xinhua. Now, al-Muhammad is staying with his parents and the rest of the family at a relative's house nearby. His neighbor, a woman in her 50s, bitterly said that they were already impoverished by the nearly 12-year-long war, and they didn't know what to do to make a living after the earthquake. ""We have yet to receive any aid or help. We have yet to receive anything. Look at our situation. We got displaced, and we felt so cold. So, what is next?"" she said. Most of these people said they wanted financial compensation to buy new homes, which is not easy for Syria as the country is going through a harsh economic situation amid economic sanctions imposed by the United States. Thaer Rahhal, an engineer with the safety team, told Xinhua that there would be more buildings to be demolished due to the damage the earthquake had caused. ""Any cracked building that has a problem we destroyed it because this building would pose a risk to the area and people,"" he said. The UN said the earthquake in Syria displaced 5.3 million people. More aid has reached Syria's quake victims but it's not enough.

""What happened here on Monday, the epicenter of the earthquake, was the worst event in 100 years in this region,"" Martin Griffiths, UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, told reporters in the Turkish province of Kahramanmaras. More than 100 countries have sent emergency response teams to Türkiye, but ""we're going to need more than that,"" Griffiths said. The UN would launch the appeal to raise money for agencies to come and help the people who've been affected, he added. ""We have a clear plan tomorrow (or) the day after to give an appeal for a three-month operation to help the people of Türkiye with humanitarian assistance, and we will do some similar one for the people of Syria,"" he said. As they are coming to the end of the rescue phase, the UN official expressed concern for the second phase of the disaster. ""The second phase of a natural disaster of this size is often a medical one, where we have huge worries here and in Syria, of the health problems which have been going on treated,"" he noted. Türkiye's response to the disaster was ""extraordinary,"" Griffiths added. The death toll from Monday's devastating earthquakes climbed to 22,327 in Türkiye, while another 80,278 injuries were reported in the country, Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca announced on Saturday night. Search and rescue efforts in ten quake-hit 10 provinces of Türkiye have now begun to turn to debris removal on the sixth day of the disaster. Rescue teams from across Türkiye and around the world were still trying to find survivors in the rubble of toppled buildings and pulled them out against all odds. However, while the number of casualties is soaring, the number of injured pulled out of the rubble was so few on Saturday. In a statement, the Turkish Medical Association warned about infectious diseases that may occur after the earthquake. Damage to infrastructure such as electricity, water, and sewerage increases the risk of water and food-borne diseases, the statement said. Risks increase for acute respiratory infections such as influenza, and coronavirus, along with the possibility of contact-transmitted diseases such as scabies, lice, fungi, and diarrheal diseases, it added. Chinese rescuers have successfully saved at least four survivors so far. An 82-member China Search and Rescue Team arrived in Türkiye on Wednesday to join earthquake relief efforts in the country. Members of the Blue Sky Rescue Team and other Chinese civil relief squads were also in Türkiye to join the international rescue work. At least 160,000 people, including foreign teams, were on the field for search and rescue efforts, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday. All the state dormitories of universities will be reserved for earthquake victims, and university students will have distance learning until the summer, he noted. Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu slammed Germany and Austria because their teams have suspended their efforts due to security threats, and criticized them for ""slandering"" Türkiye. ""Austria's search and rescue team left the job with the claim of battering ... From the first day (of the quake), 416 incidents took place. In the six days before the earthquake, 586 events occurred,"" in the region, the Turkish minister explained. ""230 people have been detained so far, there are more than 20 arrests.

322,"U.S. sanctions hugely erode purchasing power of Iranian middle, lower classes","TEHRAN, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- Although the United States claims that the Iranian people are not the target of its sanctions, the country's middle and lower classes are experiencing a huge erosion of purchasing power as a result of the unilateral coercive measures. Mohsen Mohammadi, a sales manager of a real estate office, said because of the U.S. sanctions, it has become difficult for low- and middle-class people in Iran to rent a house, let alone purchase one. Two years ago, it cost about 1.5 billion rials (3,488 U.S. dollars in the parallel market) to buy a decent housing unit with an area of almost 90 square meters. Now, that amount is hardly sufficient to pay the yearly rent of a 60-square meter one, he explained. Lying behind the soaring prices is the sharp depreciation of the rial against other major currencies over the past years as a result of U.S. sanctions. In 2018, each dollar was sold at 32,000 rials in the Iranian market, while the greenback is now priced at around 430,000 rials. In addition, as many of the construction materials in Iran are imported, they are susceptible to sanctions and fluctuations in the foreign currency market, Mohammadi said, adding the cost of construction has witnessed a fourfold increase in the past three years. Iran's automobile market is also among the sectors hit hard by the sanctions, which have made it difficult for the country to import cars and auto spare parts. Prior to the reimposition of the U.S. sanctions, a locally manufactured sedan model known as Pride, an economy car affordable by the lower class, was priced at about 300 million rials, but it is sold at about 2.88 billion rials at present. The price increase has been even more noticeable with regard to foreign automobiles. Against such unfavorable conditions, domestic automakers in Iran are gaining momentum and expanding in size in the past few years. Iran's car production has seen a steady increase since March 2019, as the country produced 671,435 vehicles from March 2019 to March 2020, and 994,156 from March 20 to Dec. 22, 2022, according to a report by the semi-official Mehr news agency. Former U.S. President Donald Trump pulled Washington out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and the world powers in May 2018, and reimposed unilateral sanctions on the country. The sanctions, which have targeted Iran's main lifelines, namely oil exports and banking sectors, were reimposed as part of the U.S. ""maximum pressure"" campaign against Iran in an attempt to negotiate a new nuclear deal with the Iranian government.",Xinhua,2023-02-12 10:23

326,"U.S. unilateral sanctions, dollar hegemony compound woes of Mideast countries","CAIRO, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Having been ravaged for years by wars and sanctions, Syria is now being battered again by catastrophic earthquakes on Monday, shattering the dreams of thousands who had hoped for a better life in 2023. In the face of heavy casualties in Syria, the United States, bowing to international pressure, announced on Thursday a temporary easing of sanctions on the war-torn country. Yet the compromise came too late for too many, whose lives have perished under the rubble while waiting for the much-needed relief aid blocked by the United States.   The tragedy is yet another testament to the U.S. misconduct in the region, which has for years fallen victim to wars, sanctions and inflation ""exported"" by Washington.  The U.S. decision to lift sanctions on Syria in the wake of international condemnation contradicts what it has claimed, namely that the sanctions did not target humanitarian aid to the quake-hit country, according to Syrian political experts. ""The United States knows that the sanctions imposed on the Syrian people were unjust and led to worsening the living conditions of the Syrians over the past few years,"" said political expert Kamal al-Jafa. By maintaining the airspace's closure and blocking the entry of any medical or relief equipment to the area, the U.S. sanctions have prevented any effort to help the affected area's residents, said Mazen Shamieh, former assistant minister for the Palestinian Foreign Ministry. Prior to the earthquakes, 90 percent of Syrians live in poverty. In the war-torn country, parents are skipping meals so their children can eat; electricity and fuel are scarcer than ever; many are increasingly unable to access clean water and health care or even to communicate with loved ones or colleagues, because of connectivity outages and failing infrastructure, said UN Special Envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen in December. Salem Abu Al-Oyoun, a displaced Syrian who moved from Aleppo to Al-Wazani camp in southeastern Lebanon, believed that the decision of the U.S. treasury to remove sanctions is a big lie that does not serve the people who have suffered from the unjust U.S. siege. Tawfiq Abu Salwan from Idlib, another refugee who moved to the town of Hasbaya in southern Lebanon, said that the U.S. lifting of part of the sanctions is a desperate attempt to improve and polish its global image. ""It will not have any effect on the ground in our country, Syria, and we consider it as non-existent.""  The earthquakes came at a time when life was already hard enough for the people in the Middle East. The double-digit inflation in the region has choked many who have already been struggling to feed themselves. Fuelling their economic woes, many scholars said, is the irresponsible monetary policy of the United States, whose eight consecutive interest rate hikes have disrupted the world economy and dampened the outlook of an economic recovery. In Türkiye, the rising consumer price inflation hit a 24-year high of 85.5 percent in October.   In Lebanon, food prices skyrocketed 143 percent between September and December in 2022, ranking third in food price inflation in the world, according to a World Bank statement. In Egypt, whose currency has lost half of its value from a year ago, the prices of rice and some vegetables have doubled over the course of a few months last year. The price of chicken in January 2023 rose to 72.26 Egyptian pounds (2.39 U.S. dollars) per kilo, a staggering 230-percent increase from 2013. The price of bread witnessed a 460-percent hike in the same period, with 10 loaves of unsubsidized bread now costing 14 Egyptian pounds, up from 2.5 pounds in 2013. Sameer Mousa, a retired veteran living in Amman, the capital of Jordan, said he has not brought fruit home for two months. ""The prices are soaring all over the world, but people living in other countries with better salaries can live well. Our salaries are low, even not enough for paying house rent, electricity bills, or water bills,"" he complained. The picture is much the same in Tunisia, where local residents find it difficult even to get a packet of milk. The shortage of dairy products in Tunisia resulted from the rising price of fodder, which forced many local cow breeders to sell their livestock.   Youssef Meriah, a 52-year-old cow farmer, used to keep 10 dairy cows and more than 40 sheep in Sidi Thabet, northwest of the capital Tunis. Now he has sold a third of his herd due to the high price of hay. ""I, just like many other farmers across the country, was forced to sell our cows as economic conditions worsen,"" he said.  Jomai Gasmi, a Tunisian political and economic analyst, said the soaring inflation in his country was closely related to the interest rate hikes of the Federal Reserve of the United States. ""If you compare the timetable, you can see that the inflation in Tunisia suddenly increased after the Fed hikes,"" Gasmi said, referring to the U.S. Fed's moves of raising the dollar's interest rate. ""It also forced the central bank of Tunisia to raise the interest rate. The last surprise rate rise was on Jan. 14, and the central bank's benchmark rate now stands at 8 percent,"" Gasmi said. It is impossible for countries like Tunisia and Egypt not to take the Fed's monetary policies into account when making choices because of the dollar's hegemonic status, said Waleed Gaballah, a professor of financial and economic jurisdictions at the Cairo University in Egypt. ""The U.S. dollar becomes a more attractive and safer haven for investors after the rises of the interest rate,"" said Gaballah, noting that since March 2022, a total of 25 billion U.S. dollars of indirect investment in the local debt instruments existed in the Egyptian market.   ""When fleeing Egypt, foreign investors needed to buy U.S. dollars, causing a drop in Egyptian pound value,"" he explained. With the U.S. dollar as the world's leading reserve currency, the United States could use the dollar's overwhelming might to transfer its crisis to the rest of the world, regardless of the repeated warnings by economists that the hikes will disrupt the world economy and foreshadow a recession. Gasmi said that it is ""disappointing and infuriating that the U.S. is exporting inflation for its own benefit and making the world pay for it."" The dollar's strength has also increased the debt-repayment burdens and deepened poverty in many developing countries, such as Lebanon which is being pushed to the verge of national bankruptcy, Gasmi added.  Adnan Bourji, director of the Lebanese National Center for Studies, said it is such a shame that the Middle East region, with its natural resources and strategic location, should suffer inflation that has been spiraling out of control. Solutions are possible if the dependence on the West and its deadly directives are abandoned, said Bourji, adding that right now the United States and other Western countries still have the upper hand in forming some of the governments in the region and imposing directives to serve its goals. Gaballah said it is ""not logical for Egypt's central bank to continue raising the interest rate and follow the U.S. Federal Reserve."" He called for a ""de-dollarization"" approach to limit U.S. irresponsible loosening or tightening of monetary policy in favor of its own interest. To hedge against the risk of falling into Washington's financial trap, more countries are embarking on the de-dollarization process, exploring ways to circumvent the U.S. currency. India, for example, is discussing plans with the United Arab Emirates to settle bilateral transactions in their local currencies. The central banks of South Korea and Australia also extended their currency swap agreement by five years to 2028. As the de-dollarization is gathering momentum, Michael Hudson, a professor of economics at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, noted that putting an alternative monetary system in place will take time. ""The whole structure will change and there's still going to be many countries using the dollar. But the dollar will just be like other countries' (currencies). It will have to pay its own way,"" Hudson said. ""It can't just issue dollar debt without pressure.""",Xinhua,2023-02-13 08:10
347,"Massive earthquakes kill over 30,000 in Türkiye, Syria as incredible rescues still bring hope","  ANKARA/DAMASCUS, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from the twin earthquakes that rocked Trkiye and Syria on Feb. 6 has climbed to 29,605 and 1,414 respectively as of Sunday evening. The number of wounded, meanwhile, rose to over 80,000 in Trkiye and 2,349 in Syria, according to official figures.  Trkiye has issued arrest warrants for 134 suspects involved in the faulty construction of buildings that collapsed in the earthquakes, Turkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said on Sunday. Three of the suspects were arrested, Bozdag told reporters. The catastrophic earthquakes have flattened more than 20,000 buildings across the 10 quake-affected regions. Yavuz Karakus and Sevilay Karakus, contractors of many buildings destroyed in the earthquake in southern Adiyaman province, were detained at Istanbul Airport while trying to escape to Georgia, the local NTV broadcaster reported on Sunday. Two more people were arrested for cutting the column of a building that collapsed in Gaziantep province, the semi-official Anadolu Agency reported.  Thousands of rescuers continued to search for any sign of life in collapsed multi-storey buildings on the seventh day of the disaster. Hopes for finding alive survivors are fading, but the teams still manage some incredible rescues. Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca posted a video of a girl child rescued at the 150th hour. ""Rescued a little while ago by crews. There is always hope!"" he tweeted on Sunday. Rescue workers pulled out 65-years old women in the Antakya district of Hatay province 160 hours after the quake, the Anadolu Agency reported. A survivor was rescued from the debris in the Antakya district of Hatay province by Chinese and local rescuers on Sunday afternoon, 150 hours after the quake hit the region.  The first batch of emergency aid, including tents and blankets, delivered by the Chinese government for earthquake relief has arrived in Trkiye on Saturday. In the coming days, more emergency supplies, including tents, electrocardiographs, ultrasonic diagnostic equipment and medical transfer vehicles will be shipped in batches from China. Syria is also receiving supplies from the Red Cross Society of China and the local Chinese community. The aid from the local Chinese community included infant formulas, winter clothes, and medical supplies, while the first batch of emergency medical supplies from the Red Cross Society of China was sent to the country on Thursday. On Sunday, Algeria and Libya also sent planes full of relief items to the quake-hit areas. Meanwhile, foreign heads of state and ministers started to pay visits to Trkiye and Syria for showing solidarity. Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias visited Trkiye on Sunday in a show of support. ""We will continue to do our best to overcome difficult times, both at bilateral and the level of the European Union,"" said Dendias, the first European foreign minister visiting Trkiye after the disaster. The visit by the Greek foreign minister comes amid long-standing tensions between the two NATO states over territorial disputes. The Qatari emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the first foreign head of a state visiting quake-hit Trkiye, met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Istanbul on Sunday. Qatar has sent the first part of the 10,000 container houses for earthquake victims in Trkiye, the Anadolu Agency reported. Also on Sunday, Foreign Minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan visited Syria, promising continuing support for the country to overcome the repercussions of the catastrophic earthquake, Syrian state news agency SANA reported.

823,"Deepening relations with China ""the only reasonable choice"" for Europe, says French expert","   PARIS, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- ""The reality should teach the Europeans that, by following the United States, they are not defending their own interests,"" French international affairs expert Bruno Guigue has said, noting that deepening relations with China is ""the only reasonable choice"" of Europe. Certain American politicians insist that the United States should ""decouple"" from China, it is because Washington's foreign policy is dominated by the geopolitical anxiety of the American leaders over China's success, Guigue told Xinhua in a recent interview. ""Instead of following the Americans' policy, the Europeans should therefore free themselves from it... For Europe, the only reasonable choice is to deepen its political, economic, and cultural relations with China,"" he stressed. For Guigue, China will not only become a leading power of the world, but also a peaceful power with whom Europe will gain advantages by cooperating with it. The contamination of Europe by Washington's unilateralism has ""unfortunately"" created an unprecedented situation, he said. ""But this (American) privilege will not last forever. The crisis in Ukraine has deepened the distrust of many countries towards Washington after the illegal seizure of Russia's assets,"" he noted.   Guigue stressed that ""China is not a danger to the Europeans, it is not a threat hanging over their heads, and it is not a 'systemic rival'."" China's participation ""with success"" in global economic competition does not seek to oust anyone nor to impose its own policies on other countries, he noted. In 2022, trade between China and Europe reached an all-time high of 847 billion U.S. dollars. ""The Europeans intend to rebalance these exchanges, it is understandable, but it is not by closing Europe to Chinese exports that they will achieve this,"" Guigue told Xinhua. Worked as a senior official in the French Ministry of the Interior from 1990 to 2008, Guigue pointed out that France and China have forged fruitful partnerships in many sectors, such as nuclear industry, aeronautics, and public health. Amid the energy crisis and soaring inflation, Europe needs even closer cooperation with China, Guigue said. ""Whether in terms of trade, technology advances, or grand infrastructure projects, it (China) will have to be reckoned with."" ""Why should Europe stay away from the planetary-scale transformations led by the Chinese companies, by their international dynamism, and by their astonishing capacity for innovation?"" he wrote. ""When a country achieves economic success, you must first try to understand why it succeeds, and then try to cooperate with it to profit from it. Those who advocate distancing themselves from China are doing the opposite: they refuse to understand this country and adopt, in principle, a negative posture. In fact, they bury their heads in the sand,"" Guigue said.   In recent years, Guigue has written several articles refuting false allegations made by Western media against China. Along with French writer Maxime Vivas and other scholars, Guigue co-authored in 2021 a book, titled ""La Chine sans oeilleres"" (China without blinders), to show a real China to the Western public.",Xinhua,2023-02-13 08:16
820,Sweden discards 8.5 mln doses COVID-19 vaccines,"   STOCKHOLM, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Sweden has discarded nearly 8.5 million doses of vaccines against COVID-19, local media reported on Sunday. The discarded doses equal to about 20 percent of vaccine doses Sweden has procured, according to Swedish Public Health Agency's statistics, Radio Sweden reported. Richard Bergstrom, Sweden's former national vaccine coordinator, told Radio Sweden that the total value of the discarded doses was 1.5 billion Swedish kronor (143 million U.S. dollars).   The main reason for doses being discarded was the fact that individuals had not had their booster doses as expected, Bergstrom explained. ""The bulk is doses that people have chosen not to take, in other words, the third, fourth, or fifth (booster) dose. These were already purchased and now have to be destructed,"" said Bergstrom. As of Thursday, 88.2 percent of all individuals aged 18 or over have received at least one dose, while 86.4 percent have received two doses or more, Swedish Public Health Agency's statistics show. Addressing the global COVID-19 vaccine disparity already in 2021, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that six times more COVID-19 boosters were administered a day globally than primary doses in low-income countries. Countries with the highest vaccine coverage ""continue to stockpile more vaccines,"" while ""low-income countries continue to wait"" for the shots -- ""a scandal that must stop now.""

824,Local charities in Syria work at total capacity to serve quake-impacted people,"  ALEPPO, Syria, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- During the past painful week after the massive earthquake that hit the already war-torn country of Syria, local charities have been working at total capacity to help the people who are suffering from the deadly tremor. The Saed Initiative is one of the charities working in Syria for years, with an aim to help people who were impacted by the 11-year war. Usually, they work during occasions such as the holy month of Ramadan, offering free iftar meals, but now they find themselves before a huge duty that could last for months. Following the earthquake, the Saed Initiative decided to create a charity kitchen that would give free meals the entire year. The group distributes between 2,500 to 4,000 meals per day in Aleppo, and they have plans to expand the capacity to distribute as many as 40,000 meals per day. Isam Habbal, the head of Saed Initiative, told Xinhua at their charity kitchen in Aleppo that the Syrians have shown unmatched solidarity during this earthquake crisis as every house sent help to the people in need. ""This is a collective work that is giving service to our community. Indeed, our community shows what it's made of. At some point, before the relief planes arrived, every house sent help, whether from their clothes, medicines, or food and money,"" he said. He said that Syrians ""proved to the world and ourselves, which is the most important, that we are all one, not separated by cities."" At the kitchen, volunteers were working hard -- some chopping vegetables, others making rice, and many more packing food boxes into cars to be delivered to displacement shelters.   Habbal said that in Aleppo, his group has 150 volunteers working around the clock to secure meal parcels for the people. At another place in Aleppo, another charity is providing food for the displaced people. Eyad Abazid, a board member of the al-Bir and al-Ihsan charity, told Xinhua that local charities have shouldered the significant duty to help Syrian people regardless of the aid from outside the country. He emphasized the importance of local charities in facing hardships, saying foreign humanitarian workers come and go. After all of this, people in the country remain together, so they must help each other. Abazid said his charity distributes 1,500 meals every day. ""No matter how much foreign assistance we receive, we should be together because these are our families that have been affected. We have to maintain the momentum of helping each other,"" he said. The UN said recently that the earthquake in Syria displaced 5.3 million people. The Syrian health ministry said the death toll of the earthquake victims rose to 1,414 dead and 2,349 wounded. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said the earthquake killed over 5,300 people in rebel-held and government areas in Syria, expecting the death toll to rise to as many as 7,000 people due to the number of people under the rubble.",Xinhua,2023-02-13 08:51
822,Christodoulides wins Cyprus presidential election,"   NICOSIA, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Former Foreign Minister Nicos Christodoulides won the runoff election on Sunday and will be the next president of Cyprus, Chief Returning Officer Costas Constantinou announced after the counting of all ballot papers. Christodoulides, who ran as an independent received 51.97 percent of the votes, compared to 48.03 percent received by his opponent, Andreas Mavroyiannis, who also ran as an independent and had the support of the left-wing AKEL party. Christodoulides will take office on March 1, to succeed Nicos Anastasiades, who already served two terms and couldn't seek re-election according to the law.   Christodoulides has served under Anastasiades as director of the Diplomatic Office of the President, as government spokesperson and foreign minister. Election analyst Yiannis Mavris told CyBC television that the voters of the right-wing DISY party tilted the scale in favor of Christodoulides, despite the fact that he caused a rift in the party by running against its leader, Averof Neophytou. Christodoulides was a DISY official before submitting his candidacy. Christodoulides invited DISY to take part in a ""general acceptance government"" he plans to announce, but the party declined the offer and said it would act as a ""responsible opposition."" The new Cypriot president will be facing several pressing challenges, including restarting the deadlocked reunification negotiations, preventing increasing illegal immigration and solving labor disputes amid high inflation. Presidential elections are held in Cyprus every five years. The Chief Returning Officer said that 406,616 out of about 561,000 registers voters cast ballot in the runoff, which equals to about 72.5 percent turnout.  ",Xinhua,2023-02-13 08:53
825,Philippine lawmaker pushes for Chinese language promotion in schools,"MANILA, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- To boost the competitiveness of Filipino workers in overseas labor markets, a Philippine lawmaker has pushed for the promotion of the Chinese language at all school levels. ""We already have the edge in foreign labor markets because our workers can speak English. We should now aspire to double that advantage by encouraging more Filipinos to learn Mandarin early,"" House of Representatives Minority Leader Marcelino Libanan said in a statement on Sunday. He added that learning Chinese, the world's most widely spoken language, will open up new opportunities for Filipinos who wish to work or travel in China, and Chinese-speaking countries such as Singapore. Libanan urged elementary and high schools to encourage the creation of Mandarin student clubs. ""We already have many young learners from Filipino-Chinese families that speak Mandarin. They can help put up Mandarin clubs in their schools,"" Libanan said.

He said that essential and urgent surgeries will be carried out without hindrance and that the measure is only temporary. The decision comes in the wake of Sri Lanka Medical Association, the national professional medical association, warning that the health sector would face a serious crisis within a few weeks, if shortages of medicines, surgical equipment, and chemicals used in labs are not addressed now. Sri Lanka has been facing a medical shortage since 2022 due to its balance of payment crisis, and the price of medicine has also gone up last year due to rising inflation.

299,Germany plays key role in calming NATO partners,"BERLIN, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Although Germany was criticized by its partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) for its ""late"" export approval of Leopard tanks to Ukraine, the country is right not to blindly rush into more and more weapon deliveries and plays a key role in calming its western allies. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz warned against a ""public competition to outdo each other along the lines of battle tanks, submarines, aircraft..."" NATO must not become a party in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, he said ahead of a special meeting of the European Union (EU). Amid this balancing act, the office of the German defense minister is considered the ""hot seat"" among ministerial posts. With his predecessor failing to finish the legislative term, the current Minister of Defense, Boris Pistorius, just took office last month.  Germany's new defense minister was appointed at a critical time when pressure from NATO partners to supply battle tanks to Ukraine was mounting. Only days after Pistorius took office, the government finally gave its green light for the tanks. What once began with 5,000 helmets, Germany is now pledging to deliver 14 modern Leopard 2 tanks and gave permission to its allies, most notably Poland, to re-export Leopard tanks from their own stocks. The export of up to 178 of the older Leopard 1 tanks was also approved. In view of the highly explosive political nature, it was Chancellor Scholz who announced the step. ""This decision follows on from our official line to support Ukraine to the best of our ability,"" said Scholz. The United States followed suit, pledging 31 Abrams tanks. The West has thus crossed an invisible line that had long been avoided. The West's military aid, Russia warned, would spark ""unpredictable"" escalation, dragging NATO members into the conflict. ""The United States and its allies are trying to prolong the conflict as much as possible,"" Russian Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu said recently in a conference call with military officials. Ukraine meanwhile is demanding more weapons and is asking for fighter jets as well. On Wednesday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated this in London during his second foreign visit since the beginning of the conflict. Germany has so far opposed the delivery of fighter jets. Due to their greater range and firepower, ""we would be venturing into dimensions that I would currently warn against,"" Pistorius said in an interview with Sueddeutsche Zeitung in late January.  Germany's ability to supply other nations with weapons is extremely limited due to the country's own undersupply. ""The shelves are almost empty,"" the Inspector General of the country's army found when taking stock last year. Germany is far from meeting NATO's defense target of 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) per year, as promised by Scholz when presenting the special defense fund. According to the latest NATO estimates, the country's defense spending was only around 1.4 percent of GDP in 2022. According to recent official remarks, it was unlikely that the country will meet the 2 percent target before 2025. Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, Eva Hoegl, criticized the ""unacceptable"" lack of action to fully equip the German military at the end of last year. Almost 20 billion euros (21.4 billion U.S. dollars) would be required to stock up on ammunition alone. Germany's current stockpile would not even last for a week in the event of a military conflict, she warned.  Germany's internal struggles aside, Europe's largest economy has not entirely given up on the idea of a diplomatic solution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Although most important decisions such as the delivery of tanks are well coordinated among western partners, the tone is different. While French President Emmanuel Macron is vowing to help Ukraine to ""victory"", Scholz is careful not to close all doors on Russia. Ukrainians would be supported for ""as long as it is necessary,"" he said during the special EU meeting in Brussels on Friday. (1 euro = 1.07 U.S. dollar)",Xinhua,2023-02-13 09:16

303,Feature: Ethiopian immigration officers embrace Chinese language to better serve Chinese nationals,"ADDIS ABABA, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Teshager Moga described the communication barrier as the prime hurdle that he and fellow officers at the Foreigners' Service Directorate within the Ethiopian Immigration and Citizenship Service (ICS) often encounter in their day-to-day engagements with foreign nationals. ""Here, nationals of different foreign countries come on a daily basis for various issues concerning their stay in our country. Unfortunately, not all of them are able to interact with us through English or other Ethiopian languages,"" the ICS officer said. Moga said the Chinese are one of the largest numbers of foreign nationals who come to the ICS to process their visa requirements and other needs. Despite their continued efforts to bridge the gaps in effectively addressing Chinese nationals, challenges emanating from the language barrier still persist. On Saturday, Moga and 19 others who have been drawn from five directorates within the Ethiopian ICS embarked on a three-month basic Chinese language training program. The short-term basic Chinese language training program, which will be offered by the Confucius Institute at Addis Ababa University, is expected to enable officers with basic Chinese language command. Betelihem Hate, one of the 20 trainees, expressed her high expectations for the training in terms of enabling them to better Chinese language proficiency, eventually helping them to enhance their services to Chinese nationals. ""This is a very good and golden opportunity. Aware of the existing communication barrier the Ethiopian Immigration and Citizenship Service had previously hired a Chinese language translator to help facilitate our engagements with Chinese nationals. However, the demand still remains high,"" Hate said. Moga also said the three-month training will not only enable him and fellow colleagues with basic Chinese language skills but also to better understand China and its people. ""I hope after this training we will be able to better interact and serve our Chinese friends, ultimately significantly improving our day-to-day service provision,"" Moga said. General Director of the Ethiopian Immigration and Citizenship Service Bruhtesfa Mulugeta spoke highly of the training during the opening ceremony, as he urged the trainees to serve as connecting bridges between the people of the two countries. ""The support we get shows the collaboration between Ethiopia and the Chinese government and institutions. It will fulfill the gap our officers have, that is a communication gap to serve our customers,"" Mulugeta said. ""One of our honorable and known customers in our services are our Chinese brothers and sisters. In this regard, the language training given by the (Confucius) Institute is crucial to fulfilling the gap."" Shen Qinmin, minister-counselor at the Chinese Embassy in Ethiopia, said cooperation in language education between the two countries cements the two countries' partnership across all sectors and serves as the mainstay of practical cooperation at all levels. He said empowering service providers, such as employees of the Ethiopian ICS, with better communication skills, will create conducive conditions in terms of improving Chinese nationals' experience in the East African country. Che Zhaoguang, the cultural counselor at the Chinese Embassy in Ethiopia, also stressed the crucial role that language plays in connecting people toward a better future. ""A lot of Ethiopian students have graduated from the Confucius Institute and they can speak quite fluent Chinese and work in big Chinese companies. They are playing an important role in promoting the friendship and cultural relations between our two countries,"" he said. Courtesy of the everblooming Sino-Ethiopian ties, the interest in studying the Chinese language is growing fast with newly opening institutes being operational across public universities in different parts of the East African country. In addition to Addis Ababa University, Chinese language studies are now provided across different public universities throughout Ethiopia, including the Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Institute, Bahir Dar University, Mekelle University, as well as Arsi University. The Confucius Institute at the Addis Ababa University, which started operation in Ethiopia in 2012, has so far registered more than 10,000 students who passed through various levels of Chinese language studies at different facilities across the country, according to figures from the institute. Addis Ababa University, with the help of the Confucius Institute, has also recently launched its first-ever Master of Arts (MA) program in the Chinese language in Ethiopia -- the Master of Teaching Chinese to Speakers of Other Languages (MTCSOL).",Xinhua,2023-02-13 09:35

329,Science and Technology Backyard project gives boost to Africa's agricultural development,"Looking back on his experience of taking part in the Science and Technology Backyard project, David Muttendango, a Zambian student at China Agricultural University, said he has learned a lot. The learning experience, which included testing soil fertility in a lab, checking the growth of crops in the fields, sharing experience in selecting seeds and cultivating seedlings with farmers, and having discussions with agricultural experts on the promotion and popularization of agricultural technologies, has been rewarding, according to Muttendango.   China has vigorously developed modern agricultural technologies and significantly improved crop yields, he pointed out, telling People's Daily that he wants to learn the technologies involved so that he can contribute to agricultural development in his hometown. The project that Muttendango benefited from was based at Quzhou Experiment Station of China Agricultural University (CAU), and launched in 2019. It aims to train talents in agricultural science and technology for African countries through farming practice and technological exchanges. Adopting an educational model that emphasizes the importance of practice and the combination of practice and theory in solving problems, the project arranges for foreign students to take part in farming activities, first to discover problems, then to acquire basic knowledge and methods through theoretical courses, and finally to go to the front line of agricultural production to solve problems using the theoretical knowledge they have gained. Muttendango is one of the first batch of students of the project. Corn yield in Zambia has long remained at between 1 and 3 tonnes per hectare, while in China it has exceeded 6 tonnes since 2020, he noted, adding that he came to China to learn how the country improves crop yields through agricultural technologies. After more than three years of learning in China, Muttendango has found the answer to his question. He discovered that while Zambian farmers seldom take measures to replenish their soil with nutrients, most Chinese farmers have a good knowledge of scientific fertilization methods. Furthermore, the selection of high-yield crop varieties and improvement in irrigation facilities for farmland, among other practices, also contribute to the increase in crop yields, according to Muttendango. So far, the project has trained more than 60 students for 12 African countries. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has given high praise to the project for its practice-based educational model, and recognized it as one of the best poverty reduction practices in 2021. In 2022, a demonstration village for agricultural development and poverty reduction under the Science and Technology Backyard project was unveiled in Malawi. At the village, students taking part in the project seek technological innovations and conduct demonstrations and experiments together with local farmers, in a bid to improve farmers' agricultural production skills and increase crop yields. Many African countries are faced with challenges such as food insecurity and poverty, pointed out a Malawian student of the CAU, noting that the Science and Technology Backyard project not only helps African students master advanced agricultural technologies, but also promotes the sustainable development of agriculture in Africa. ""The Science and Technology Backyard project focuses on exchanges in agricultural technologies between China and African countries and the cultivation of talents, so as to help more African farmers benefit from China's advanced agricultural technologies,"" said Wang Wen, an official of the College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, CAU.",People's Daily Online,2023-02-13 13:53

310,Rescue Diary in Türkiye: Hope for more miracles,"We returned to the place where we we were staying at about 2 a.m. on Feb. 11 and then headed for the quake-hit areas again at 9:35 a.m. the same day. Since kicking off the rescue operations in Malatya, Türkiye on the morning of Feb. 9, we have conducted search and rescue work in five areas over three days. Malatya is one of the most severely-hit areas, and the search and rescue environment here is complex and constantly changing. We experienced a few aftershocks during the demolition of the collapsed structures. The aftershocks were moderate and barely felt by those standing, but could be clearly felt by those who were trying to enter the collapsed structures. As we encountered falling rubbles, we had to suspend our rescue operations and leave the area. When we came back, we saw the gaps between the collapsed structures had been filled with rubbles due to the aftershocks. Nonetheless, these difficulties didn't stop us from looking for signs of life.   When the red light on the life detector started blinking, we rushed to the corresponding site to search for survivors. We immediately responded to local residents' requests for rescue and clues they provided to carry out the work. Before we were finally able to create the necessary conditions for life detection through the use of snake eye life detectors, we had to spend a long time carrying out demolition operations. No matter how long it might take, we wouldn't give up on any chance to save lives.   Our assistance has been warmly received by the local volunteers, who have been very kind in helping us carry out our rescue operations. Our translators include a Chinese person who runs a business in Türkiye and a Turkish citizen who has studied in China. Both gave us a thumbs-up for our assistance.   Although they didn't have enough living materials to support themselves, local residents brought us food to express their gratitude.   We join hands to carry out search and rescue operations in dangerous situations as the aftershocks occur. We hope that more miracles can happen. ",People's Daily Online,2023-02-13 14:28
309,U.S. easing sanctions on quake-hit Syria proof of indifference to humanitarian needs,"CAIRO, Feb. 13 (Xinhua) -- After the tragic loss of at least 3,500 lives in quake-hit Syria, the United States, bowing to international pressure, announced a temporary easing of sanctions on the war-torn country. It came four days after the strong earthquakes rocked on Monday, missing the Golden 72 hours for rescue. The sanctions led to a severe humanitarian crisis for the Syrian people. The easing of sanctions illustrates how Washington's previous claims that its sanctions don't target aid to the quake-hit country were utterly false, clearly revealing U.S. indifference to the humanitarian situation in Syria.  As of Sunday night local time, at least 3,500 people were killed in both the government-control and rebel-held areas, according to the Syrian government and aid agencies. The earthquake hit Aleppo, Latakia, Tartous, and Hama in northern Syria and the rebel-held Idlib province. Many Syrians criticized the brutal U.S. blockade surrounding their country from every direction, which has badly hampered rescue work and led to high casualties. On Thursday, the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued Syria General License 23, which, according to its announcement, ""authorizes for 180 days all transactions related to earthquake relief that would be otherwise prohibited by the Syrian Sanctions Regulations."" Thuraya al-Saeedi, a displaced Syrian living at the Sarada camp in southern Lebanon who lost four of her relatives in Aleppo, said the U.S. decision comes too late. Syria's Health Minister Hassan al-Ghabbash noted that the suffering of Syria's medical sector is not a result of the recent massive earthquakes that hit the country on Monday but rather the Western sanctions imposed on Syria for 12 years. ""Due to a lack of tools, some rescuers had to dig through the rubble with bare hands in search of survivors in snow and rain,"" said Muhammad Hijazi, chairman of the Aleppo Governorate Council.  The U.S. eased sanctions only after repeated calls from international organizations and several countries. On Thursday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres announced that ""the humanitarian crisis in northwestern Syria was already worsening, with needs at their highest level since the conflict began."" He stressed, ""this is a moment in which everybody must make very clear that no sanctions of any kind interfere with relief to the population of Syria in the present moment."" For his part, Geir Pedersen, UN special envoy for Syria, said that ""emergency response must not be politicized."" On Thursday, the first UN aid convoy crossed from Türkiye to Syria's northwestern Idlib province. The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Wednesday demanded an immediate lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria as the tremor-stricken country is facing a severe humanitarian crisis. ""Even today, U.S. troops still occupy Syria's principal oil fields, plunder more than 80 percent of the country's oil production, and have smuggled and burned Syria's grain stock, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis there,"" said Mao Ning, spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry. On Thursday, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian deplored the U.S. sanctions on Syria, saying they have exacerbated the situation of the quake-hit people in the Arab country. Wasel Abu Youssef, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization's Executive Committee, said the humanitarian catastrophe in Syria requires an end to ""collective punishment, especially the Caesar Act imposed by the United States,"" adding the U.S. sanctions on Syria ""have no justification for their continuation."" The Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019, also known as the Caesar Act, is a piece of U.S. legislation that sanctions the Syrian president and government over what Washington claimed to be ""war crimes against the Syrian people."" The act was signed into law by former U.S. President Donald Trump in late 2019 and came into effect in mid-2020.  Experts said that the U.S. announcement softening sanctions ""to support earthquake relief efforts"" proved the country's previous lies that its sanctions don't target humanitarian aid to the quake-hit country. Syrian political expert Mohamed Al-Omari told Xinhua that ""the U.S. Treasury's announcement is a confession"" that Washington lied by claiming its sanctions did not affect humanitarian aid. Kamal al-Jafa, another Syrian political expert, echoed that if the previous U.S. claims were correct, it would not have decided to ease the sanctions for six months. ""This decision indicates that Washington knows the sanctions imposed on the Syrian people were unjust and led to worsening the living conditions over the past few years,"" he added. Some experts said that Washington's latest move is far from enough to alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people. Adel Samara, a Palestinian political expert from the Ramallah-based Palestinian Center for Policy Research and Strategic Studies, told Xinhua the U.S. move is merely a show for the media, with little change on the ground. Saeb Rawashdeh, a political analyst at the Jordan Press Foundation, said relieving transactions for 180 days shows ""a lack of concern for the actual well-being of the Syrian people."" ""The Syrian people deserve access to the resources and support they need to recover and rebuild their lives and communities, regardless of political considerations,"" he added. Ahmed Maher Abo-Gabal, an Egyptian researcher in international relations and political affairs, said U.S. Treasury's announcement comes too late given the high death toll. ""Six months is by no means enough time for reconstruction in the quake-hit areas,"" he added.",Xinhua,2023-02-13 14:31

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Monday that the death toll from quakes in rebel-held areas in northwestern Syria stood at 4,300, while 7,600 others were injured. Meanwhile, the Syrian health ministry estimated that the earthquakes have killed 1,414 people and wounded 2,349 others in government-controlled areas.",Xinhua,2023-02-14 10:25
292,Biden's agenda in State of Union address to drive inflation higher: The Hill,"  WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 (Xinhua) -- While U.S. President Joe Biden often claims he is laser-focused on combatting inflation, his policies as shown in the latest State of the Union address say otherwise, according to a recent report by The Hill. The report, published on Friday, gave three reasons. Firstly, there was little suggestion in Biden's address that exorbitant federal spending would come down any time soon. Besides, the president's proposed Buy American program will drive infrastructure costs higher. What's more, Biden's ongoing dedication to unionization would lead to higher labor costs; his war on fossil fuels has discouraged higher oil and gas production, and the Federal Reserve will ""have its hands full bringing inflation down to 2 percent,"" said the report. It also pointed out that Biden's address was ""peppered with expensive new promises."" For example, he continues to advocate forgiving certain student loans, and is demanding ""family medical leave"" and ""affordable child care."" But, ""who pays for that?"" the report asked.",Xinhua,2023-02-14 10:48
285,Overturning of gun regulations worries U.S. domestic violence survivor advocates: CNN,"   NEW YORK, Feb. 13 (Xinhua) -- Advocates for domestic violence survivors are worried that a controversial federal court ruling striking down a gun control measure will discourage victims from coming forward, reported CNN on Sunday. Earlier this month, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that those under domestic violence restraining orders have a Second Amendment right to bear arms, saying a federal law barring those alleged abusers from possessing guns is unconstitutional. The risk of homicide in a domestic violence situation increases by 500 percent if a gun is present, according to research cited by the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. ""Though some of the states covered by the appeals court have similar state law restrictions, the new ruling undermines a crucial tool that survivors have in protecting themselves from their abusers,"" said the report. If the 5th Circuit's logic was adopted nationwide by the U.S. Supreme Court, the consequences would be devastating, advocates were quoted as saying.",Xinhua,2023-02-14 10:53
289,7 U.S. big cities have lost half of their populations: 24/7 Wall St.,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 (Xinhua) -- Seven U.S. cities once among the country's biggest metropolises ""have become shadows of their former selves,"" as they have lost more than half of their populations, U.S. news portal 24/7 Wall St. reported Sunday. The seven ""very well known"" cities are Flint, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Youngstown, St. Louis, and Detroit, the news outlet said, after it compared historical editions of the U.S. Census Bureau's decennial census, starting with 1950, to the recent population figures. ""We listed all seven cities that were within the 100 most populous cities in the U.S. in 1950 and have lost more than half of their populations as of July 2021,"" it said. Reasons for population decline in these cities are various, including job losses, housing discrimination, and racial economic inequality, the media said. The remaining residents in these cities ""are more likely to struggle to find work and live in poverty,"" the report said, adding that some cities are among the hardest-hit areas in the ongoing opioid epidemic.",Xinhua,2023-02-14 10:55
286,U.S. train derailment reveals grave system flaws: The Guardian,"LONDON, Feb. 13 (Xinhua) -- The recent derailment and explosion of a train carrying vinyl chloride near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border in the United States revealed grave flaws of the country's rail system, British newspaper The Guardian has reported. The Ohio catastrophe is ""wake-up call"" to dangers of more deadly train derailments, said the report published Saturday. It said the incident forced thousands to evacuate in East Palestine, a town of about 5,000 people. Ron Kaminkow, an Amtrak locomotive engineer and former Norfolk Southern freight engineer, blamed ""ineffective oversight and a largely self-monitoring industry that has cut the nation's rail workforce to the bone in recent years as it puts record profits over safety."" The Pittsburgh region alone has seen eight train derailments over the last five years, according to the public health advocacy group Rail Pollution Protection Pittsburgh, and about 1,700 annually occur nationally. U.S. rail companies laid off more than 20,000 rail workers during a year period in 2018-2019, representing the biggest layoffs in rail since the Great Recession. The nation's rail force has since dipped below 200,000, the lowest level ever, and down from 1 million at its peak, said the report.",Xinhua,2023-02-14 11:16
288,Finland plans rehab measures for eastern areas bordering Russia,"HELSINKI, Feb. 13 (Xinhua) -- Finland's Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment on Monday published a development blueprint for the eastern part of the country, which has suffered from the closing of the border with Russia and the end of cross-border cooperation and tourism. The blueprint lists measures from industrial development to education, improved transport infrastructure and security. It highlights business activity and jobs created through the energy revolution, as well as the development of a sustainable tourism offer to meet international demand. The closing of the border with Russia in 2022 greatly impacted the business and industrial conditions in the area. Forest industries, of key local economic importance, have begun using Finnish wood instead of Russian. Confidence in growth has waned and already confirmed investment decisions have been suspended, the report noted. Until the 1990s, Finland had developed all its areas, but during the past three decades, the emphasis has shifted to global innovation networks, noted Sami Moisio, professor of Helsinki University in the report. However, eastern Finland could become a prime industrial area if the European Union attains the goal of industrial and technological sovereignty.",Xinhua,2023-02-14 11:23
287,UN experts gravely concerned over deaths at hands of U.S. police,"   UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 13 (Xinhua) -- United Nations experts have expressed grave concern over the deaths of two Black men in January in the United States at the hands of police, saying the use of force may have violated international norms. Keenan Anderson died on Jan. 3 at the hands of the Los Angeles Police Department and Tyre Nichols died on Jan. 7 after he was beaten by police in Memphis, Tennessee, according to the UN experts. ""The brutal deaths of Keenan Anderson and Tyre Nichols are more reminders of the urgency to act,"" Yvonne Mokgoro, chairperson of the UN International Independent Expert Mechanism to Advance Racial Justice and Equality in the context of Law Enforcement, said in a statement released last Friday. The experts stressed that in both cases, the force used appears to have violated international norms protecting the right to life and prohibiting torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It is also not in line with standards set out under the United Nations Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, they noted. Responding to the death of Tyre Nichols, the experts emphasized that in addition to effectively investigating, prosecuting and punishing the perpetrators and providing redress to victims and their families, U.S. authorities should show determination in questioning and reforming an institutionalized police culture that permits criminal assault under the guise of law enforcement and public safety. ""We have called on authorities to ensure prompt accountability and reparation,"" said Tracie Keesee, member of the Expert Mechanism. Mokgoro said the Expert Mechanism will be conducting an official mission to the United States in April ""to ensure that police brutality is addressed with determination and that victims and their families obtain justice."" The UN International Independent Expert Mechanism to Advance Racial Justice and Equality in the context of Law Enforcement was established in July 2021 to make recommendations, inter alia, on the concrete steps needed to ensure access to justice, accountability and redress for excessive use of force and other human rights violations by law enforcement officials against Africans and people of African descent.",Xinhua,2023-02-14 11:30

295,Survivors finding shelter in makeshift tent cities in quake-hit Türkiye,"ISTANBUL, Feb. 13 (Xinhua) -- A week after twin earthquakes devastated southern Türkiye that killed tens of thousands and left many more homeless, many survivors now find themselves living in makeshift tent cities. Guarded by military personnel, the tent cities provide not just temporary housing units erected by volunteers, nongovernmental organizations, and Türkiye's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD), but also mobile kitchens, psychological support facilities and social spaces. Large piles of donated clothes are distributed to survivors there by AFAD and the Turkish Red Crescent. One survivor staying in a tent city in the port district of Iskenderun in the southern province of Hatay told the local daily Hurriyet that they do not know how long they will be staying or how they'll ever get used to it. ""We found a tent to stay in, but we don't have a single thing to put in it. There is no heater or any fuel,"" said another woman who had recently settled in, according to the report. Saban Helvaci is staying with his seven-member family at a tent city in the town of Samandag, also in Hatay, Anadolu Agency reported. ""We were at home when the earthquake hit and got out without looking back. We spent a day walking in the rain and stayed at the park. We couldn't get any clothes because our dressers had toppled ... I spent two days soaked with back aches. Fortunately, they gave me some medicine here, and I'm doing better,"" he was quoted by the report as saying. Hatay, which is on the southern tip of Türkiye bordering Syria, was hit particularly hard by the dual earthquakes on Feb. 6, and existing tent cities are not enough to meet the need for housing survivors. The 115-tent city where Helvaci is staying will be soon accompanied by another 225 tents in the Samandag stadium in Hatay, Anadolu reported. The AHBAP Association, a local non-governmental relief organization, built the Ahbap tent city in Hatay, providing shelter for around 3,000 families. Meanwhile, Kalyon Holding, a Turkish construction firm, has begun building container shelters that will temporarily house another 3,000 families in the southeastern province of Gaziantep. In the southern province of Kahramanmaras, a total of 1,500 tents in two tent cities were erected in the town of Elbistan, also the epicenter of the second 7.6-magnitude quake. ""The first day was very difficult, but then help began arriving from all around the country,"" said Seref Kuscu, a resident of one of the two tent cities, told Demiroren News Agency. ""We're fine with regard to food and clothes. Our biggest issue here is the cold. The things we need the most are heaters and coal,"" he said. The southeastern city of Diyarbakir, one of the 10 provinces hit by the earthquakes, is also expected to get 4,200 new tents. The death toll from the quakes in Türkiye has so far reached 31,643, according to official figures.",Xinhua,2023-02-14 13:03

Assad made the call during his meeting with Martin Griffiths, UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, who visited Syria and toured quake-hit areas in Aleppo on Monday before meeting Assad in the capital Damascus. The president also highlighted the importance of focusing international efforts on helping rebuild the infrastructure in Syria, calling it a matter of urgent necessity for the return of Syrian refugees. For his part, Griffiths said the United Nations seeks to support the relief efforts and meet the humanitarian need of the Syrians. The twin earthquakes measuring 7.7- and 7.6-magnitude that rocked Syria on Feb. 6 have so far killed about 5,300 people in the government-controlled and rebel-held areas, according to the latest figures released by the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

""The Syrian Red Crescent does not have sufficient equipment because of a devastating war in the country since 2011,"" said al-Sayegh. The current freezing weather in Syria and Türkiye constitutes another serious obstacle to relief efforts since the major earthquakes struck the two countries on Feb. 6, she warned. IFRC allocated 1 million Swiss francs (1.09 million U.S. dollars) to the Syrian Red Crescent and 2 million Swiss francs to the Turkish Red Crescent immediately after the earthquakes to enable their urgent assistance in rescuing and providing relief, medical treatment and shelter for survivors, according to the IFRC spokeswoman. The latest figures show the death toll of the twin earthquakes measuring 7.7- and 7.6-magnitude has climbed to 31,643 in Türkiye and around 5,300 in Syria. Commenting on the current U.S. sanctions on Syria, al-Sayegh said the sanctions impede and delay the delivery of humanitarian aid to earthquake-hit Syria. ""We do not interfere in politics. What we care about is not neglecting the affected people in dire need of support and assistance, especially in natural disasters,"" she said, hoping that the recent U.S. move to ease its sanctions on Syria will reflect positively on relief efforts in the country.

The death toll from Monday's earthquakes in Trkiye has climbed to 31,643, the country's disaster agency was quoted by the Anadolu Agency on Monday as saying, bringing the total fatalities with neighboring Syria to more than 35,000，with tens of thousands injured.  The UN relief chief said in quake-hit Syria on Monday that as the UN relief efforts enter a humanitarian phase, the urgency is to cover such needs as shelter, food and schooling and that the plan now is to cover three months of humanitarian needs in Syria. Afghanistan's Red Crescent Society donated 4.5 million afghanis (50,000 U.S. dollars) in cash to help the quake-affected people in Trkiye, the state-run Bakhtar news agency reported Monday. The first batches of relief supplies bound for Trkiye and financed by the Chinese government arrived in Istanbul on Feb. 11 and 12. More supplies provided by China, including electrocardiograph machines, ultrasonic diagnostics equipment, medical transport vehicles and manual hospital beds will be shipped this week. Rescue teams from China, including those dispatched by the Chinese government, have rescued over 10 survivors.

256,"Interview: U.S. blowing up Nord Stream pipelines ""economic war"" against European allies: Swedish expert","STOCKHOLM, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- The truth that the U.S. Navy was involved in the Nord Stream pipelines explosions last year, as discovered by American investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, was an ""economic war"" against its submissive allies in Europe, a Swedish expert has said. ""Nord Stream (was) of course blown up by the U.S. and NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization) allies,"" said Jan Oberg, director of the Transnational Foundation for Peace and Future Research, in a recent interview with Xinhua. Hersh, a Pulitzer Prize winner, said the U.S. Navy divers, operating under the cover of a widely publicized mid-summer NATO exercise known as BALTOPS 22, planted the remotely triggered explosives last June in cooperation with Norway, which destroyed three of the four Nord Stream pipelines three months later. ""Seymour Hersh's fine analysis tells how the destruction was planned and done, but the conclusion is unsurprising: the U.S., with very important Norwegian assistance, committed the crime against a friendly, allied country, Germany, and other European countries,"" he said. ""Together with ill-considered, never-ending economic sanctions against Russia, the blowing-up of Nord Stream by the U.S. has already caused enormous, accumulating harm to European citizens' economy,"" he added. ""The present situation is extremely dangerous: We live in times fundamentally characterized by intellectual and ethical disarmament coupled with immense military armament, with militarism as the only one answer to the problems,"" Oberg said. ""The West chooses to use weapons, threats, secret operations and media manipulation instead of using talks, mediating, engaging the UN or OSCE (the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe), and it abandons diplomacy and plays tough on others,"" he said. ""Militarism has become the religion that keeps the declining West together, with NATO (as) its church. That's why also the Western mainstream media won't give Hersh's sensational analysis the attention it deserves,"" said Oberg. ""One must wonder when the Europeans will wake up and finally understand that they no longer share interests with the U.S.,"" he said.

264,UN chief calls for better global cooperation to achieve common goals,"UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 13 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday called for concrete actions to improve global cooperation to address the world's current and future challenges. Briefing the UN General Assembly about his report ""Our Common Agenda,"" launched in September 2021 as a guide to realizing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Guterres said important progress has been made but much more remains to be done. ""We need to go further and deeper,"" he said. ""On climate, on conflict, on inequality, on food insecurity, on nuclear weapons -- we are closer to the edge than ever."" ""And yet our collective problem-solving mechanisms do not match the pace or scale of the challenges,"" he said. The UN chief pointed out that the present forms of multilateral governance, designed in and for a bygone era, are clearly not adequate for today's complex, interconnected and rapidly changing and dangerous world. The SDGs were unanimously adopted by world leaders in September 2015 to serve as the blueprint for global development efforts in the years leading up to 2030. The 17 goals aim to end poverty, fight inequalities and tackle climate change. Guterres warned that halfway to 2030, ""we are far off track,"" and called for moving the recommendations in Our Common Agenda from ideas to action, as well as from abstract to concrete. ""We will only make up lost ground by addressing the gaps and challenges that have emerged since 2015 -- including gaps in intergovernmental cooperation,"" he said. The SDG Summit to be held in September at the UN headquarters must mark significant progress, Guterres said, urging member states to bring a clear commitment to rescue the SDGs by setting out their national vision for transformation, grounded in concrete plans, benchmarks and commitments. Meanwhile, he said throughout this year, his office will be issuing a series of 11 policy briefs with concrete ideas, addressing issues such as peace and security, finance, global digital cooperation, the peaceful use of outer space and how to strengthen the United Nations for the 21st century. ""This must be the year when we lay the foundations for more effective global cooperation that can deal with today's challenges as well as new risks and threats down the line,"" said Guterres.",Xinhua,2023-02-14 13:43
274,California COVID-19 cases top 12 million: report,"  LOS ANGELES, Feb. 13 (Xinhua) -- The total number of COVID-19 cases reported in California, the most populous state in the United States, has topped 12 million, the Los Angeles Times reported on Monday. That milestone was hit last week in the state, home to around 40 million residents, according to data compiled by the biggest newspaper on U.S. West Coast. The statewide tally -- just under 12.02 million cases as of Friday, according to The Times' tracker -- is undoubtedly an undercount, because of both limited access to testing in the pandemic's early days and the fact that many people now self-diagnose using at-home tests, the report noted, adding that ""even so, the figure constitutes a population larger than that of all but six states."" The report pointed out that California is seeing increased circulation of the Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5, which has been described as perhaps the most infectious strain of the coronavirus. XBB.1.5 accounts for an estimated 56.9 percent of new cases in the Western region of the country. Despite its infectiousness, XBB.1.5 has not spawned a major spike in hospitalizations, according to the report.   This is the first year that California did not experience a devastating surge coinciding with winter, a development many officials attribute to the widespread administration of vaccines, the report added. California Governor Gavin Newsom announced in October last year that California's COVID-19 State of Emergency will come to an end on Feb. 28, 2023, after being in effect for almost three years since March 4, 2020. U.S. President Joe Biden's administration also announced last month that it will end COVID-19 emergency declarations on May 11.

257,New Zealand declares national state of emergency in response to Cyclone Gabrielle,"  WELLINGTON, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government declared a National State of Emergency on Tuesday before Cyclone Gabrielle unleashes its full fury. This is only the third time in New Zealand history that a national state of emergency has been declared. Emergency preparations have been underway as power outages, flight cancellations, and school closures are seen in six North Island regions including Auckland, New Zealand's largest city. ""This is an unprecedented weather event that is having major impacts across much of the North Island,"" said Minister for Emergency Management Kieran McAnulty after signing the declaration Tuesday morning. The declaration will apply to the six regions that already declared a local State of Emergency on Monday. This declaration will enable the government to support the affected regions, provide additional resources as they are needed, and help set the priorities across the country for the response, McAnulty said. ""A national state of emergency gives the National Controller legal authority to apply resources across the country in support of a national level response,"" he said. This is only two weeks after Auckland and the adjacent region Waikato were inundated by record downpours and floods. The government has asked residents to prepare sandbags to buffer their homes, store food and water, and be ready for necessary evacuations in the coming days. Many sandbag stations have been set up across Auckland overnight, and locals are encouraged to prepare their own sandbags for extreme situations. New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins has urged people to ""take the severe weather warning seriously"" and ""stay at home, cancel all unnecessary travels."" The New Zealand government announced an 11.5 million New Zealand dollars (7.25 million U.S. dollars) Community Support Package on Monday to help people affected by the recent floods and their preparations to respond to Cyclone Gabrielle. More than 25,000 people have been supported with food, clothing, shelter, bedding and medication. People have lost their homes and vehicles, families are facing additional challenges getting their children back to school and many families will be facing anxiety and distress from the significant disruption of the floods and impending cyclone, said Minister for Social Development and Employment Carmel Sepuloni. Monday's package sits alongside a suite of supports that the government has put in place to enhance the emergency response in Auckland.        ",Xinhua,2023-02-14 14:07
258,Evil under the sun -- the U.S. history of unethical human experiments,"BEIJING, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- ""It is peaceful. The sun shines. The sea is blue. But you forget ... there is evil everywhere under the sun."" The stinging famous line written by ""Queen of Crime"" Agatha Christie in her mystery tale ""Evil Under the Sun"" that unveils the darkness of murders could not be truer. It is just that crimes in the real world are often much more appalling. Just take a look at what the United States has done. For nearly a century, the self-proclaimed ""beacon of human rights"" has used thousands of Americans and innocent citizens from other countries as unwilling guinea pigs in its human experiments, and has gotten away with it almost every time. This ugly yet unnoticed past, as former Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom said, is every inch a ""crime against humanity.""  When Allen Hornblum started his work as a literacy instructor in Philadelphia's prison system in 1971, he noticed right away something unusual and chilling behind the walls: Many inmates at Holmesburg Prison, most of whom were African American men, had patches or gauze pads on their backs, which, Hornblum found out later, were the results of longtime and extensive human experiments. ""It really is a very dark mark on Philadelphia's history,"" Hornblum told Xinhua outside Holmesburg, describing the prison nicknamed The Terrordome as ""arguably the largest human experimentation center in the United States."" Government records showed that from 1951 to 1974, hundreds of Holmesburg inmates were intentionally exposed to pharmaceuticals, viruses, fungus, asbestos, and even dioxin. Those human trials, led by dermatologist Albert Kligman associated with the University of Pennsylvania, had different sponsors, including major pharmaceutical companies and the U.S. military.   ""The inmates were not particularly sophisticated. The vast majority of them were unschooled,"" Hornblum said. ""Even though they were the subjects, they were not told what they were being injected with or having rubbed on them."" In return for slim payment in the jail -- 1 U.S. dollar or sometimes 1.5 to 2 dollars a day -- the inmates had to suffer from symptoms like itchy skin, rashes, discolorations and fevers, and in some cases, they became more violent. But they were ""left somewhat incompetent until they recovered from whatever drugs they had been given,"" said Hornblum. After giving up his job in the Philadelphia Sheriff's Office in 1993, Hornblum started to write his maiden book on the horrifying subject. Following the publication of ""Acres of Skin"" in 1998, Holmesburg's inmates learned what had gone on for the first time and started to join ranks. Subsequently, Hornblum met Edward Anthony, a test subject ""in a series of very, very nasty, unethical experiments that basically destroyed his life, or at least that portion of his life."" When Anthony got back on the street, he was ""still suffering in many ways,"" said Hornblum, who later penned ""Sentenced to Science,"" ""basically one Black man's account of what happened to him as a human guinea pig."" Anthony and many other victims ""don't trust the medical community anymore because they saw how themselves and others were mistreated and used and abused."" Similar tragedies befell Alabama. Starting from 1932, the U.S. Public Health Service and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recruited 600 African American men, including 399 with latent syphilis and a control group of 201 others free of the disease, for a notorious study called the Tuskegee Experiment. According to an audio interview in 1977 by the Harvard University Schlesinger Library with public health nurse Eunice Rivers Laurie, a key actor in the drama, the participants, promised free medical care, were never informed of the real nature of the study, which was to observe the effects of syphilis when untreated. Despite the fact that penicillin became the standard treatment for the disease some 15 years into the study, those men were still provided with nothing but disguised placebos like aspirin and mineral supplements. It was until late 1972 that a leak to the press finally resulted in the termination of the study. By then, 28 patients had died directly from syphilis, and 100 from complications related to the disease. Besides, 40 of the patients' wives were infected with syphilis, and 19 children were born with congenital syphilis. Adding to the U.S. criminal record was a set of unethical medical experiments on at least 2,600 incarcerated men in the 1960s and 1970s by the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). According to the UCSF's internal investigation unveiled in December last year, the experiments included putting ""pesticides and herbicides"" on the men's skin and injecting them into their veins. In many cases there was no record of informed consent.  On Oct. 1, 2010, then U.S. President Barack Obama telephoned his Guatemalan counterpart, Colom, to apologize for a series of dodgy human experiments the United States did in 1946-1948 on Guatemalans. In those experiments, U.S. public health doctors intentionally infected hundreds of people with sexually transmitted diseases in what was meant as an effort to test the effectiveness of penicillin. The participants were enrolled without consent. It was only in 2009 when Susan Reverby, a historian of U.S. health care, found a personal file of John C. Cutler containing records on medical experiments conducted in Guatemala in the second half of the 1940s and brought the unethical studies to light.   ""Researchers deliberately exposed about 1,300 inmates, psychiatric patients, soldiers and commercial sex workers to the sexually transmitted diseases syphilis, gonorrhea or chancroid,"" said a report by the U.S. Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues published in 2011, adding, ""Careful examination of thousands of pages of treatment and follow-up records indicates that at least 83 subjects died."" Pablo Werner, a Guatemalan human rights lawyer investigating the case, told Xinhua the miseries went far beyond the participants themselves. ""We found many children of syphilis patients directly affected. Some were prone to early miscarriages, and others unable to have children. Many children were infected with syphilis at birth, and some died at three to four months of age,"" Werner said, adding that many victims and their families have yet to receive compensation. Across the North Atlantic, the Nigerian government's taking on U.S. multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporation Pfizer in 2007 provided insight into the U.S. misdeeds on the African continent. In 1996, a severe meningitis epidemic broke out in northern Nigeria's state of Kano. During this time, Pfizer decided to test ""Trovan"" on the population suffering from the epidemic, a new anti-meningitis drug approved in the United States for use by adults but not children. Without any informed consent, Pfizer allegedly administered Trovan to 200 Nigerian children, 11 of which died due to the drug and the remaining developed conditions including hearing impediments, brain damage, blindness and paralysis. The company denied any wrongdoing, stating that the children died of meningitis rather than their drug. An out-of-court settlement was reached in 2009 for, allegedly, 75 million dollars to Kano and 175,000 dollars to four families of children killed. Nigerian virologist Oyewale Tomori, also former president of the Nigerian Academy of Science, told Xinhua that Pfizer took advantage of the situation and carried out drug trials not in line with medical ethics because the parents of those sick children, ignorant as they were, were desperate for medical treatment. The inhumane trials on human bodies continued in the 21st century. A report published in 2017 by the U.S. Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) revealed that in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the CIA turned to a wide range of health professionals for ""illegal and unethical research on prisoners."" They designed and implemented torture such as waterboarding and sleep deprivation, monitored and collected data ostensibly to manage harm, and maintained abusive detention conditions and treatment. In one particular case, they carried out an ""aggressive"" interrogation of a detainee named Abu Zubaydah. ""A period of escalating mistreatment followed, so extreme that personnel were warned to 'prepare for something not seen previously' and some were affected to the point of tears,"" said the report. Russia's disclosure about the U.S.-funded biolabs in Ukraine since 2022 has also sent jitters around the globe. ""There is only one country in the world that is operating hundreds of military biolabs on another country's territory and spending billions of dollars to do so, and that is the United States,"" said Igor Nikulin, former inspector of the UN Commission on Chemical, Bacteriological and Biological Weapons. The secretive military-backed biolabs worldwide controlled by the United States pose a serious threat to global security, said Kenya-based international relations scholar Cavince Adhere.  In August 1947, U.S. judges sitting in judgment of Nazi doctors accused of conducting murderous and torturous human experiments in the concentration camps formulated the Nuremberg Code, a 10-point set of rules for the conduct of human experiments. It regulates that the voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential, and that experiments should be conducted so as to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injury.   Later in 1964, the World Medical Association developed the Declaration of Helsinki for the medical community, a set of ethical principles regarding human experimentation. The fundamental principle of the declaration is respect for the individual, his or her right to self-determination and the right to make informed decisions regarding participation in research, both initially and during the course of the research. ""The medical community disregarded it (the Nuremberg Code). They thought it was an obstacle. So they didn't abide by it,"" Hornblum said. ""Some very smart people shoved ethics away because they saw it as an imposition, as a problem, as something that's gonna block them from their scientific quests. And that's why there are so many instances in prison and other institutions where people were used as guinea pigs for medical experimentation."" The type of research on prisoners or detainees done by the CIA ""is the very reason the Nuremberg Code protocols were developed. In the course of facilitating the crime of torture, U.S. health professionals committed a second and related crime: human subjects research and experimentation on detainees being tortured, in violation of medical ethics and U.S. and international law,"" said the report by the PHR. Clara de Paiz, a social investigator who once followed the Guatemala case, told Xinhua those human experiments have seriously violated the Declaration of Helsinki, as U.S. medical staff never warned the subjects of the possible dangers. Pfizer's drug trials in Nigeria violated the World Health Organization's guidelines on drug testing, and the medical ethics that pharmaceutical companies should abide by, said Tomori, adding that traumatized by the incident, many Nigerians are still suspicious of foreign drugs and vaccines, making it hard for the government to carry out successful vaccination campaigns amid the COVID-19 pandemic. For many, the U.S. contempt of widely-acknowledged medical regulations is born out of a deep-rooted disrespect for humanity, both home and abroad. The participants in the Philadelphia case, Hornblum said, ""were basically forgotten, the way doctors use lab rats or dogs or monkeys or chimpanzees."" Back in the 1940s, U.S. researchers had shown no respect for Guatemalans, using them as though they were an inferior and disposable race, and although more than 70 years have passed, the United States still refuses to see Guatemala as an equal, said de Paiz.",Xinhua,2023-02-14 14:37

260,Ohio alarmed by toxic chemicals,"  The fiery derailment of a train in Ohio is generating health concerns with reports of more toxic chemicals involved than previously thought. The derailment occurred on Feb 3 in East Palestine, a village of 4,700 people in northeastern Ohio near the Pennsylvania border, about 50 miles northwest of Pittsburgh. About 50 of the 150 cars on the Norfolk Southern Railroad train derailed as it traveled from Illinois to Pennsylvania. Residents have filed a federal lawsuit in the derailment and are seeking to force Norfolk Southern to set up health monitoring for residents in Ohio and Pennsylvania. The lawsuit filed Thursday by two Pennsylvania residents calls for the rail operator to pay for medical screenings and related care for anyone living within a 30-mile (48-kilometer) radius of the derailment to determine who was affected by the release of toxic substances. The lawsuit also is seeking undetermined damages. No one was injured in the derailment, which investigators said was caused by a broken axle. Three days after the accident, out of concern of a possible explosion, authorities decided to release and burn vinyl chloride inside five tanker cars, sending hydrogen chloride and the toxic gas phosgene, used during World War I battles, into the air. Vinyl chloride is a colorless, industrially produced gas that burns easily and is used primarily in the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe and other products, according to the National Cancer Institute. It also is a byproduct of cigarette smoke. Environmental regulators have been monitoring the air and water in surrounding communities and have said that so far, the air quality remains safe and drinking water supplies have not been affected. But some residents have complained about headaches and feeling sick since the derailment. On social media and in news reports, some said that fish and frogs were dying in local streams. Kirk Kollar of the Ohio EPA said the levels of toxic chemicals observed in nearby waterways ""were immediately toxic to fish"", Newsweek reported. Some shared images of dead animals or said they smelled chemical odors around town. The arrest of a reporter during a news conference about the derailment led to online criticism of the law enforcement response. Melissa Henry, an East Palestine resident, said that she and her two boys had stayed with her parents for nearly five days while waiting for the derailment to be cleaned up. She left on Saturday before the mandatory evacuations were ordered because her youngest son's ""eyes turned red as tomato and he was coughing a lot"", she said.   A town hall has been scheduled for Wednesday at 7 pm to allow residents to ask questions about the effects of the derailment, East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway said in a press release Sunday. US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who spoke at a National Association of Counties Conference on Monday, received some criticism for not mentioning the Ohio derailment in a discussion about infrastructure. A Norfolk Southern list of the cars that were involved in the derailment, and the products that they were carrying reveal several more toxic chemicals that were released into the air and soil after the crash, ABC News reported. Among the substances were ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, ethylhexyl acrylate and isobutylene. Contact with ethylhexyl acrylate, a carcinogen, can cause burning and skin and eye irritation; inhalation can irritate the nose and throat, and cause shortness of breath and coughing, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The toxins that burned in the wreckage had the potential to be deadly if officials did not evacuate the region, experts told ABC News last week. Some of the toxins spilled into the Ohio River — a drinking water source for 5 million people and the largest tributary of the Mississippi River — near the north West Virginia panhandle, causing officials to shut down water production in the area and transfer to an alternate water source, West Virginia Governor Jim Justice told reporters on Feb 8. On Feb 12, the US Environmental Protection Agency, after monitoring the air, said it had not detected contaminants at ""levels of concern"" in and around East Palestine, although residents may still smell odors, The New York Times reported. Just after the derailment, about 1,500 to 2,000 residents in East Palestine were told to evacuate the area. Schools were closed, along with some roads. On Feb 6, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine extended an evacuation order to include anyone in a 1-by-2-mile area surrounding East Palestine, including parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania. On Feb 8, the governor's office said residents were permitted to return home. ""It raises all kinds of questions,"" DeWine told Fox &Friends last week when he was asked whether hazardous materials are too dangerous to transport by rail. ""We've seen it up close and personal the last few days. This is a big, big deal."" Norfolk Southern offered residents who did not want to return home assistance with hotel expenses. On Twitter, financial commentator @unusual_whales, which has 1.1 million followers, wrote of Norfolk Southern: ""The $55 billion dollar company has offered the town $25,000, or $5/person, for the accident.""",Chinadaily.com.cn,2023-02-14 15:15
263,Rescue Diary in Türkiye: Moments of kindness touch our hearts amid rescue operations ,"  Mushy soup, macaroni, and bread -- these are our meals at the camp canteen. Although it's humble fare, mealtimes give us a rare chance to take a break during the day. February 13 marked my fifth day of officially being part of the rescue efforts in Türkiye. As assigned, I have been staying at the campsite with some of my teammates from the Blue Sky Rescue Team (BSR) to manage logistics, such as sorting the international disaster relief supplies delivered to the campsite and setting up camps for international rescue forces who are currently on their way.   Meanwhile, some teammates led other newly arrived team members in Malatya to the rescue site to obtain first-hand rescue information and clarify which areas have been searched and not searched, ensuring that the rescue operations are comprehensive, accurate, and efficient. Despite working over 20 hours a day, we are always touched by heartwarming moments, whether it’s locals sending us snacks or volunteers expressing their gratitude. Their kindness has driven away our cold and fatigue.   I remember that two days ago, when we were on a bus to the next site for search and rescue missions, we learned that it was the birthday of a local passenger onboard. We sang a birthday song to him in Chinese. He was moved by this special “gift” and thanked us for coming all the way to Türkiye to carry out the rescue efforts.

275,Rescue Diary in Türkiye: Professional transnational rescue operation - we did it!,"As of Feb. 13, Türkiye's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) had carried out a comprehensive deployment of large-scale excavating equipment in earthquake-stricken areas. The rescue coordination and command center of the Ramunion rescue team assessed the local situation and believed that we had completed our rescue tasks and could leave for home. After receiving approval to leave from the Chinese Embassy in Türkiye and China's Ministry of Emergency Management, Ramunion gave orders to our team members on the front line: All personnel and equipment would evacuate Türkiye's Hatay Province on the afternoon of Feb. 13 local time and return to China in the small hours of Feb. 15.   Looking back on our rescue experience in the country, I can remember how people gave us warm looks as we arrived at Istanbul Airport six days ago. They were so anxious for us to reach the quake-stricken areas as soon as possible that they were even willing to let us take their flight to go first. We have all been hoping for miracles. However, earthquake rescue is not an easy job. It relies on science, respect for facts, a rational and rigorous attitude, and cooperation among team members. We often have to carry out a massive search and conduct assessment of the structure of a building and the security of the surrounding environment before demolishing it. I think I will remember the frightened face of the child we rescued in Belen town on Feb. 9 for the rest of my life.   I can still recall the excitement of Wang Bin, the deputy head of our rescue team, when we finally confirmed that the people we were trying to locate were still alive. Before that, we had spent more than three hours working at the site, inspecting and demolishing the building. ""We found them! We found them!"" he cried. It was a family of five. The mother couldn't speak when she was carried out, but tried her best to give a thumbs up to the rescuers. There was thunderous applause from the crowd. Everyone had been waiting so eagerly to see lives saved. As of the evening of Feb. 12 local time, the rescue team of Ramunion had searched 178 collapsed buildings in four cities of Hatay Province, rescuing and helping rescue a total of 24 people. Among them, nine survived. The world needs mutual assistance and love. The rescue operation has given me an opportunity to get to know Türkiye. When we worked together with the local people, I was deeply impressed by their modesty, courtesy, rigorous manner, and carefulness.   When you provide assistance to others, you have to respect and understand them. Our team members have also impressed the local people with our respect for the local customs, our professionalism and scientific approach in rescue work. I believe we have made it. We have carried out a transnational rescue operation in a professional manner. Chinese people enjoy having a major influence in the world. As we become better versions of ourselves, we are able to help and influence others. The rescue team of Ramunion has taken part in 17 transnational rescue operations. The team’s professionalism is a reflection of China's strength in international humanitarian assistance. I'm convinced that as long as we do a good job in everything we think is worth doing, we will win the admiration of the entire world.             ",People's Daily Online,2023-02-14 18:13
266,"Türkiye's quake death toll exceeds 35,000, as intensifying diplomacy helps mend ties between foes","   ANKARA, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from last week's powerful earthquakes in southern Türkiye rose to 35,418 on Tuesday, while intensifying diplomacy between Türkiye and its previous foes helps further ease their ties. A total of 105,505 people were injured in the tremors, of whom 13,208 are still receiving treatment in hospitals, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said at a press conference after a cabinet meeting. In another speech made during the day, Erdogan said that the number of people rescued from the rubble was over 8,000. The Turkish government has provided shelter for a total of 1.6 million earthquake victims, while Qatar has been sending 10,000 containers to Türkiye via ships, which will be turned into shelters.   Talking about foreign support and aid, Erdogan said teams from 84 countries participated in the quake rescue efforts in Türkiye. At least 47,000 buildings were severely damaged in the quake-hit zone, the Turkish president said, pledging to start the construction of 30,000 new housing units in early March. It is estimated that more than 2 million people evacuated from the quake zone, which is home to nearly 13 million people, he said. Türkiye was hit by two massive earthquakes measuring 7.7- and 7.6-magnitude on Feb. 6, which affected a 500-km-wide region spanning 10 Turkish provinces.   John Lee, chief executive of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), said on Tuesday that the HKSAR government will send about 30 million Hong Kong dollars (about 3.82 million U.S. dollars) worth of supplies to the quake-hit areas in Türkiye. More than 100 tons of supplies donated by Hong Kong citizens were delivered to Türkiye on Monday evening, he said. Several Chinese official and civilian teams have been taking part in the search and rescue efforts for nearly a week in Türkiye in the wake of the two massive earthquakes. With foreign rescue teams flocking to the country to aid the rescue efforts and world leaders extending condolences to the Turkish victims, the earthquake diplomacy paved the way for pushing forward Türkiye's normalization processes with its foes.   Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias visited the Turkish quake-hit zones on Sunday, accompanied by his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu. Meanwhile, Erdogan had phone talks with Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou and Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. The two neighbors have been at odds over territorial claims in the Aegean and the Eastern Mediterranean. Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen paid a visit to the Turkish capital Ankara to show solidarity with Türkiye on Monday, as the two sides continued the momentum of normalizing strained ties. Israel sent a 450-member rescue team on the first day of Türkiye's devastating earthquakes last week, followed by the establishment of a field hospital in the quake-hit region, Cohen said.   Cavusoglu will hold a press conference with his Armenian counterpart Ararat Mirzoyan in the capital Ankara on Wednesday. The two top diplomats met on the sidelines of an international conference last year to discuss ways of ending their decades-old hostilities. The relations between Türkiye and Armenia were severed in 1993 during the first war between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh when Ankara closed the border with Armenia in support of Azerbaijan. The two neighbors have stepped up the normalization dialogue since last year.",Xinhua,2023-02-15 08:15

(Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO) has urged governments and civil society to work together to ensure cross-border delivery of humanitarian aid between Türkiye and Syria and within Syria itself. The WHO's Regional Director for Europe, Hans Kluge, called the earthquakes ""the worst natural disaster"" in the region in a century, and emphasized the importance of all parties cooperating on aid delivery. ""The needs are huge, increasing by the hour. Some 26 million people across both countries need humanitarian assistance,"" said Kluge during a press conference on Tuesday.   Türkiye has suffered cataclysmic casualties, Kluge underlined, with more than 31,000 deaths and 100,000 people injured due to the earthquakes. An additional one million people are estimated to have lost their homes, and are currently living in temporary shelters. Meanwhile, almost 5,000 people have died in northwest Syria across the border, and the death toll is expected to rise. The WHO also warned that there were growing concerns over health risks related to cold weather, hygiene and sanitation, and the spread of infectious diseases. Meanwhile, with 80,000 people currently hospitalized, the Turkish health system, is under enormous strain -- after suffering significant damage in the disaster.   The WHO has launched an appeal for 43 million U.S. dollars to help with the earthquake response, and Kluge said this amount was likely to double in the coming days due to the huge scale of need. According to Kluge, the funds would be used to assist the most vulnerable by providing trauma care, essential medicines, and mental and psychosocial support. They would also be used to ensure the continuity of routine health services.",Xinhua,2023-02-15 08:38
267,"Residents near Ohio train derailment report dead fish, chickens: U.S. media","NEW YORK, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- For days, authorities have been telling residents of the area around East Palestine, Ohio, the United States, that it is safe to return home after a 150-car train carrying hazardous chemicals derailed Feb. 3, NBC News reported Monday. But one resident told local media that her five hens and rooster died suddenly last Tuesday. The day before, rail operator Norfolk Southern had burned train cars carrying vinyl chloride, a flammable gas, to prevent an explosion, the report said. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources said the chemical spill resulting from the derailment had killed an estimated 3,500 small fish across 7.5 miles (about 12 km) of streams as of last Wednesday. ""For some people who live near the derailment site, the reports continue to spur fear that they and their animals might be exposed to chemicals through the air, water and soil,"" said the report. After the controlled burn, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) warned area residents of possible lingering odors but noted that the byproducts of vinyl chloride can emit smells at levels lower than what is considered hazardous. The EPA classifies vinyl chloride as a carcinogen; routine exposure could increase one's risk of liver damage or liver cancer. Short-term exposure to high concentrations can cause drowsiness, loss of coordination, disorientation, nausea, headache or burning or tingling.",Xinhua,2023-02-15 08:40
270,WWF calls for global treaty to protect high seas,"  GENEVA, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) on Tuesday urged governments to protect the world's oceans by finalizing a long-awaited High Seas Treaty at the United Nations (UN) in New York this March. The first-ever treaty on high seas biodiversity would provide a globally recognized mechanism to designate marine protected areas, and is crucial in order to achieve the goal of protecting at least 30 percent of the world's oceans, Jessica Battle, WWF's senior global ocean governance and policy expert told Xinhua in a video interview. One of the main impacts of human activities on the ocean is fishing, Battle highlighted. At the Fifth International Marine Protected Areas Congress (IMPAC5) which took place in Vancouver, Canada, from Feb. 3-9, the WWF called on policymakers to accelerate global ocean protection from 8 percent to 30 percent within eight years.   Previously, at COP15 in Montreal in December, the goal of protecting and conserving at least 30 percent of the world's marine and coastal areas was adopted by 196 countries under the Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). ""China played a very strong role at COP15, making sure that we did get an agreement by the 196 parties to halt and reverse nature loss by 2030,"" said Battle, who will attend the negotiations in New York. In a resolution in December 2017, the UN General Assembly decided to convene an intergovernmental conference to draw up the text of an international legally binding instrument on the conservation and use of marine biodiversity.  However, the UN's negotiations for a High Seas Treaty stalled last August as delegates said more time was needed to reach an agreement on a final text. Governments must ensure that the ocean receives the level of attention and protection it needs in order to provide for the future, Battle said.   Waters which lie beyond national jurisdictions, known as the high seas, comprise nearly two-thirds of the ocean's area. However, only about 1 percent of this huge swath of the planet is protected, WWF said. Battle said the treaty would be ratified when 30 countries sign up to it, and it is then implemented into national legislation. It is critical that the treaty should enter into force quickly, Battle said.  WWF also said that the ocean faces new potential threats such as deep seabed mining, a nascent industry with the potential to cause irreparable harm to fragile deep-sea ecosystems. ""We are seeing a growing number of countries calling for a global moratorium ... This will be agreed at the International Seabed Authority which meets three times a year in Jamaica,"" Battle said.   ""We need to safeguard this very important environment in order to reach biodiversity goals, and also to safeguard the ocean as a carbon sink."" Many ocean areas play a key role for important species of shark, tuna, whale and sea turtle, and they also support billions of dollars of economic activity annually, WWF has said. In its ""Reviving the Ocean Economy"" report, the organization outlined that the goods and services that flow from the ocean and coasts are worth at least 2.5 trillion U.S. dollars each year, and the overall value of the ocean as an asset is 10 times more.",Xinhua,2023-02-15 08:43
269,"'Serious' Ohio chemical leak being ignored by US govt, media; aftermath could linger for 20 yrs","The aftermath of an Ohio train derailment accident, which released toxic chemicals into the environment, has been haunting residents in the affected area for more than a week, but the accident had barely caught attention of American mainstream media outlets until very recently. Chinese experts warned that the chemical leak accident, ""underestimated by the US,"" poses a serious safety hazard for Americans living in the affected area, with lingering effects of at least 20 years. They also believe US authorities' ""controlled burn"" of the toxic gas could release more lethal substance into the environment, which they said fully exposed US government's irresponsible attitude toward people's health. The fact that such a catastrophe occurred for more than a week without being extensively reported also reflects toxic trend in US political and media circle, who are too obsessed with creating imaginary enemies, and hyping outside ""threats"", such as the Chinese balloon, that they pay little attention to their own people's calls. On February 3, a train carrying toxic chemicals derailed in East Palestine, Ohio. About 50 of the train's 150 cars ran off the tracks. Vinyl chloride was slowly released into the air from five of those cars before crews ignited it to get rid of the highly flammable, toxic chemicals in a controlled environment, creating a dark plume of smoke. The next day after the derailment, an official alert warned that local residents needed to move even further away from the disaster zone. The controlled burn reportedly worked and the evacuation order for East Palestine residents was officially lifted on February 8 after authorities claimed real-time air and water monitoring did not find any contaminant levels above screening limits. Yet residents feared for their health as concerns have mounted about the aftermath the chemical leak caused to the environment. Many residents living near the affected area took to social media to report their symptoms after the accident. A Twitter user said on Monday that it ""smelled like a campfire mixed with burning rubber in Pittsburg today. Lots of folks reported headaches."" A Chinese student who lives about two hours' drive from the affected area told the Global Times that she did not feel discomfort immediately, but she is now suffering from rhinitis and dizziness, which never occurred to her before. Four Chinese students in Pittsburg, which is about one hour away from East Palestine, Ohio, said that the local government has tried to whisk away danger of spillover of the incident, yet the public is suspicious. Many people are now stockpiling mineral water, for fearing the water may be contaminated, some supermarkets are even out of stock of bottled water, said one Chinese student surnamed Xu. On Sunday, the US Environmental Protection Agency [EPA], after monitoring the air, said it had not detected contaminants at ""levels of concern"" in and around East Palestine, although residents may still smell odors. Working with Norfolk Southern and the Columbiana County Emergency Management Agency, the EPA had screened the air inside about 290 homes as of Monday, and said it had not detected vinyl chloride or hydrogen chloride, which can cause life-threatening respiratory issues. The EPA did not respond to the Global Times as of press time. Peng Yingdeng, an expert from China's central government supervision center for environmental protection and emergency management, said that the chemical leak constitutes a serious safety accident, and may impose ""long-term"" health threat to populations nearby. Vinyl chloride is highly inflammable, said Peng, noting that if the vinyl chloride is not burnt completely, it will release more toxic dioxins and phosgene. Dioxins is very difficult to degrade naturally, and once it permeates into soil, may remain there for decades, Peng said. He noted that the grains produced from this soil will cause cancer and mutation inside human bodies. Health experts also called US authorities' handling of the Ohio derailment ""irresponsible and unscientific."" Ding Xuejia, a professor from Beijing University of Chemical Technology, said that controlled burn is a wrong way to deal with vinyl chloride, noting that after being burnt, the vinyl chloride will release substances that are many times more toxic as the gas itself. Those toxic substances can enter human bodies, go into water body and air, and cause serious damage to people and the environment, said Ding. He predicted without further interference, the aftermath of the incident will linger for at least 20 years or even longer, and probably will lead to surge of number of cancer patients. He urged local residents to take timely health check just in case. The US, as a benchmark that leads global technology, has set up a very bad example in handling such hazard situation, which will cause negative impact on handling risks in chemical industries globally, said Ding.  Apart from fear, some Americans also expressed outrage as they believe the government is hiding information from the public, and that the mainstream media barely reported the accident until most recently. Stew Peters, a US journalist, posted on Twitter on Monday with shocking video of the explosion saying that ""This is Ohio's Chernobyl. Ohio: Dead fish and cattle being reported as far as 100 miles away from the site. Journalists covering the story have been arrested. What the HELL is going on?"" US law enforcement officers interrupted NewsNation correspondent Evan Lambert as he broadcast from the disaster zone and arrested the journalist on February 8 under the name of criminal trespassing and resisting arrest. The police insisted that a confrontation occurred between Lambert and a National Guard official after the journalist was told to stop speaking during the Ohio governor's remarks on the train derailment. Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a Tuesday briefing that why some self-labeled free and unbiased media have deliberately ignored the incident such as the Ohio train derailment, which is detrimental to American people's health? The incident, however, has picked up steam on Chinese social media in recent days. As of time of press, three or the 50 most searched topics on China's Sina Weibo were related to the Ohio incident. Hashtag ""release of vinyl chloride in Ohio has caused evacuation of residents"" has been read on Weibo more than 59 million times as of press time. Many netizens even wondered whether the US recent hyping of Chinese balloon, which happened at almost the same time as the train derailment incident, is a move deployed by the US government to divert the public's attention. Zhang Zan [pseudonym], a Chinese student in Ohio said she saw little mainstream media coverage of the story in previous days. ""The newspaper is full of the Chinese balloon stories, and now the media is dominated by the Super Bowl."" Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, believes that the US media's early ignorance of Ohio chemical leak incident is aimed at deliberately diverting public's attention, and reflected a toxic trend in the US media and political circle. ""US media are very biased and selective of news topics. Compared with such a terrible incident that concerns lives of hundreds of thousands, they believe a balloon story is more eyeball-grabbing,"" said Li, explaining that media's ignorance of the incident is a result of a domestic political atmosphere that has been poisoned for years with the so-called China threat, and Washington has long hyped outside ""threat"" to divert public dissatisfaction on US domestic affairs. The Ohio accident actually exposed the fact that US is suffering from ""political cancer"" as the government now whisked away simmering public concerns over a health catastrophe, but politicians tried a repertoire of tricks to make a fuss about a harmless Chinese balloon, said Li.",By GT staff reporters (Global Times) ,2023-02-15 08:51
272,Shifting blame will not help U.S. cure deep-rooted drug abuse,"(ECNS) -- Twelve percent of global drug users come from the United States, three times the proportion of the U.S. population to that of the world, according to a report titled ""Drug Abuse in the United States."" That makes the U.S. the country with the worst drug problem in the world. During the past 12 months, 48.2 million Americans over the age of 18 consumed marijuana at least once. Drug abuse in the country has led to problems like violent crimes and family discord. Despite the alarming numbers and facts, the U.S. government makes inadequate efforts in publicizing the dangers of drug abuse, which has wrongly led some people to associate it with so-called ""freedom."" Driven by interests, the U.S. government instead promotes the legalization of drugs, resulting in the loss of countless lives. Drug abuse has long been a devastating public health disaster in the U.S., however, some U.S. politicians and media have been hyping up false information that ""precursor compounds imported from China are illegally used to manufacture fentanyl"" to confuse right and wrong, making China a scapegoat and hampering Sino-U.S. anti-drug cooperation. If the U.S. continues to shy away from the problem, it will eventually poison itself. To eradicate the root of the problem, it should strengthen law enforcement on drug control and regulation of fentanyl and other drugs, rather than mislead its public, blame other countries, and shift the responsibility for its own inadequate governance. Otherwise, the drug problem may loom for a long time in the country.",Ecns.cn,2023-02-15 09:01
271,Balloon incident much paranoia about nothing,"For the past week or so, the United States has been in the grip of rampant paranoia over what it has termed as a ""Chinese spy balloon"" and the alleged sighting of several other ""unidentified flying objects"". As a show of force, and in a display of domestic political theater, the Joe Biden administration has been shooting them down. These objects, portrayed as threats to the national security of the United States, are being used to weaponize mass hysteria with a view to push a sporadic anti-China agenda, as the Biden administration strives to push US defence spending up to unprecedented levels, and rope in allies to militarily and strategically contain Beijing. Recognizing how the US weaponizes fear, mass hysteria and paranoia in pursuit of its goals is key to understanding US politics as a whole. While in theory, the US is a decentralized federal democracy with many layers of government, the historical trajectory of the last half of the 20th century has conditioned a dramatic centralization of power in lieu of the challenges the country faced while emerging as a hegemonic state, including the Cold War, the countercultural revolution of the 1960s, the ""global war on terror"", and now the struggle against China. Simply put, in order to strengthen unity and build a consensus on the US' international goals in a deeply divided country, American statecraft has veered toward weaponizing fear and mass hysteria to sustain its agenda and power amid the rise of mass media. The US, after all, is a populous and diverse country which, throughout its history, has sought to hold together the entire population under one ideology despite the vast socioeconomic and ethnic fractures that were once enough to trigger a full-blown civil war. These factors have created a structural arrangement through which the US leadership strives to centralize power in a decentralized country, and likewise must secure democratic consent for policies which, by and large, are hegemonic including those promoting endless wars and encouraging political interferences in other countries' internal affairs. And to do so, US politicians have learned to cultivate paranoia, drama and mass hysteria as a means to drive the political agenda and consensuses in their direction, by creating constant fear of a given ""other"" which in each scenario, threatens the ""exceptional"" ideology and values of the US. In doing so, the US constantly exaggerates and amplifies the perceived threat to its national security, interference in its internal affairs by, or the ill intentions of, its designated opponents in a bid to mandate public consent for its aggressive foreign policies. This includes highly dubious allegations of spying, espionage and subversion. The US portrays its enemies as all-powerful, all-threatening and omniscient actors far beyond their real capabilities, which it uses to spread panic among Americans, prompting them to believe they ""must act now"" against it. Such portrayals include manufactured news such as Saddam Hussein possessing ""weapons of mass destruction"", the Democratic People's Republic of Korea planning to ""launch a nuclear strike against the US"", ""Russia interfering in US elections"" and ""China purportedly spying on the US"" in a whole range of areas. The spy-balloon and UFO drama is being used by the administration and the Pentagon to manufacture support for increased defence spending and mass militarization. Last year, the Biden administration weaponized the events in Ukraine to reorient its foreign policy to much more aggressively contain China militarily. The Biden administration places greater emphasis on the encirclement of China by deepening its alliances with other countries, which is more belligerent and provocative than the policy of the Donald Trump administration, which despite its ""America First"" policy was not so militaristic. This helps the administration to seek domestic support for even higher military spending, and spread the same paranoia and fear into other countries to lock them into the strategic agenda it is setting. The US has found in the balloon controversy the perfect pitch for such a narrative, reminding us once again that the calibration of orchestrated drama and fear is a critical aspect of the US' hegemonic foreign policy. Using this fear, the US strives to raise the stakes of ideological confrontation and pretend every foreign policy issue is a ""do or die"" moment for the country. This has transformed US politics into a hotbed of paranoia, irrationality and instability which poses risks to the security and stability of the world at large.",Chinadaily.com.cn,2023-02-15 09:23

234,Israel to resume direct flights to Türkiye: FM,"  ANKARA, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel will resume direct flights to Trkiye on Thursday as part of the normalization of bilateral relations, Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said on Tuesday. ""Flights from Israel to Trkiye will resume in two days. Three of our main carriers will start flights,"" Cohen said at a joint press conference with his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu in the Turkish capital of Ankara. ""We will definitely warm the important relations between your important and beautiful country and Israel,"" he added. The two sides discussed steps to take bilateral ties to the next phase, Cohen said, adding ""we will restore bilateral relations to its former level."" Israel sent a 450-member rescue team on the first day of Trkiye's devastating earthquakes last week, which was followed by other teams and the establishment of a field hospital in the quake-hit region, the minister said. Cohen promised to continue humanitarian assistance to Trkiye and conveyed deepest condolences to the victims. Cavusoglu, for his part, said Israel was one of the first countries that sent support to Trkiye and thanked Israel for the assistance. Israeli rescue teams were one of the ""largest"" on the ground and they provided ""very serious support"" to the emergency response, he said. The relations between Israel and Trkiye became strained in 2010 when a Turkish-led flotilla attempting to break Israel's blockade on the Gaza Strip clashed with Israeli forces, leaving 10 Turks on board killed. The two countries have been working to mend their ties since last year, when Israeli President Isaac Herzog made an ice-breaking visit to Ankara, the first of its kind by an Israeli leader since 2008. They also reappointed ambassadors in 2022, who were expelled by each other after Israeli forces killed 60 Palestinians during the protests on the Gaza border against the opening of the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem in 2018.

238,Chinese rescue teams assisting quake-hit areas in Türkiye,"Devastating earthquakes that recently took place in southern Türkiye and near-border regions in Syria have killed and injured lots of people in the two countries and leveled buildings. The Chinese government has launched an emergency humanitarian assistance mechanism at the earliest time possible to provide emergency aid to the two quake-hit countries.   As of Feb. 12 local time, the China Search and Rescue Team, which is under unified coordination and command of the Chinese government, had freed six survivors, including a man in his fifties who was jointly saved by Chinese and Turkish rescuers on the afternoon of Feb. 12 after four hours of efforts. So far, the team has sent 206 rescuers in 13 batches to quake-hit areas in Türkiye, who saved six survivors and found eight victims. Besides, rescuers from Hong Kong also extracted three survivors from rubble. Eighty-two members of the team arrived in Türkiye on Feb. 8, local time, to join earthquake relief efforts in the country. On the afternoon of the same day, they reached Antakya, a harder-hit city in the southern province of Hatay, Türkiye. They started working before dawn on Feb. 9 and extracted a pregnant woman from the debris at dusk in cooperation with their Turkish counterparts. Later, they freed two more females, even the ""Golden 72 hours"" for rescue had passed.   On Feb. 10, the China Search and Rescue Team saved another female survivor in the city, and two days later, an adult male was extracted from earthquake debris near the place where the fourth survivor was discovered. At the same time, several civil Chinese rescue teams also joined the rescue efforts in Türkiye. Eight earthquake relief experts from the Rescue Team of Ramunion in Hangzhou, east China's Zhejiang province, arrived in Türkiye on Feb. 8 and rescued a man and a child on the same night. A day later, the team extracted a family of five from a collapsed civil house in the town of Belen in Hatay province.   The Blue Sky Rescue Team, a Chinese civil relief squad, also has 127 members on rescue missions in the Turkish city of Malatya, which is near the epicenter. After dozens of hours, they saved a female from the rubble. Besides, Chinese construction machinery manufacturer Zoomlion, Beijing Emergency Rescue Association, Green Boat Emergency Rescue and Shenzhen Rescue Volunteers Federation also sent rescuers to Türkiye. As of 9 a.m. on Feb. 10, 288 rescuers from 15 civil Chinese rescue teams had arrived in quake-hit areas in Türkiye.

239,Number of days lost to strikes in UK highest since 1989: ONS,"   LONDON, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom (UK) lost about 2.5 million working days in 2022 to continued labor disputes, the highest number in more than three decades, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said on Tuesday. In December 2022 alone, 843,000 working days were lost because of labor disputes, the highest number since November 2011, taking the annual total to a new record. In 1989, 4.1 million days were lost, the ONS noted. ""The number of working days lost to strikes rose again sharply in December. Transport and communications remained the most heavily affected areas, but there was also a large contribution from the health sector,"" ONS Director of Economic Statistics Darren Morgan said.   The UK has been under waves of strikes since last summer over pay disputes. Amid consistently high inflation, pay growth among employees has failed to keep up. According to the latest ONS data, when adjusted for inflation, growth in total and regular pay fell on the year in October to December 2022 by 3.1 percent for total pay and by 2.5 percent for regular pay. It remained among the largest falls in growth since comparable records began in 2001. ""Although there is still a large gap between earnings growth in the public and private sectors, this narrowed slightly in the latest period. Overall, pay continues to be outstripped by rising prices,"" Morgan said.  ",Xinhua,2023-02-15 10:31
242,Chinese enterprises donate funds to support feeding program at Kenyan slum school,"  NAIROBI, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- The umbrella body for Chinese enterprises operating in Kenya on Tuesday donated funds to support the feeding program at Mcedo Beijing School based in Mathare slums in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya. Among the attendees, who graced the donation ceremony which coincided with handing over of renovated classrooms, were diplomats, senior officials from Kenya China Economic and Trade Association (KCETA), teachers, students, and parents. Zhang Yijun, the minister counselor at the Chinese Embassy in Kenya, said the donation toward the provision of breakfast and lunch for the young learners will be key to motivating them to study hard and realize their dreams. The Chinese Embassy in Kenya funded the construction of Mcedo Beijing School in 2007 and in November 2012, the KCETA raised money to support the expansion of the learning facility whose student population currently stands at 526. In addition, the umbrella body for Chinese enterprises in Kenya has funded the renovation of the school's facilities like classrooms, ablution blocks, kitchen and staff rooms. The installation of a 13-kw solar mini-grid system with a battery energy storage capacity of 20 kw, wiring, lighting of all classrooms and installation of security lights has converted Mcedo Beijing School into a modern learning facility. Liu Chenghui, acting chairman of KCETA, said the monetary donation to support the feeding program at the school is expected to boost students' enrollment and overall academic performance. Liu said that Chinese enterprises based in Kenya are keen to support the academic and career pursuits of local youth as a means to strengthen bonds of friendship and the realization of shared dreams. ""We are convinced that with our joint efforts and contribution, China-Kenya friendship and cooperation will grow from strength to strength with a bright future."" Benedict Kiage, director of Mcedo Beijing School, noted that financial support from Chinese enterprises has ensured that young learners are properly fed, and are supplied with books, desks and sporting kits. Kiage said that renovation and expansion of the school, installation of the solar lighting system and construction of a perimeter wall have raised its stature within Mathare slums and nearby settlements.

The assessment published by Finland's Ministry of the Interior covers 21 nationally significant threat scenarios and disruptions, ranging from hybrid influence activities and armed conflicts to natural disasters, industrial accidents and climate phenomena. The previous risk assessment was published in 2018. The assessment anticipates sudden incidents targeted at Finland that have an impact on the vital functions of society and require the authorities to adopt exceptional measures or even request help from other countries. According to the report, climate change, the digitalization of societies, hybrid influence activities and networked value and production chains are further examples of development trends and phenomena in the operating environment of threats and disruptions. There are two new threats compared with the previous report: multiple simultaneous large wildfires and an extremely powerful space storm, national broadcaster Yle said.

The authors of the analysis, published last week in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, were quoted as saying that their findings underscored disparities in the nationwide rise in suicides first reported last year by the agency. The number and age-adjusted rate of suicides had begun falling in 2019 across the United States, but increased in 2021, climbing to nearly 2018's peak of 14.2 suicides per 100,000 people. Now, the CDC's new analysis finds 2021's increase was worst among American Indian or Alaska Native people. Rates climbed 26 percent from 2018, from 22.3 to 28.1 per 100,000 people. Rates also climbed significantly for Black Americans -- a 19.2 percent increase from 2018 -- and for Hispanic or Latino people, up 6.8 percent, according to CDC data. Only one group saw a statistically significant decline in their age-adjusted suicide rate: non-Hispanic White people, whose rate dropped 3.9 percent, from 18.1 to 17.4 per 1000,000 people, the report said.",Xinhua,2023-02-15 10:51

However, ""only 33 officers and eight criminal investigators are responsible for over 100,000 emergency calls each year across the reservation, which is about the size of the state of Connecticut,"" reported ABC News last week. The officers and investigators are all federally funded, and the tribe says it's just not enough, it noted. The tribe sued the Bureau of Indian Affairs and some high-level officials in July 2022, alleging the U.S. federal government is not complying with its treaty obligations nor its trust responsibility by failing to provide adequate law enforcement to address the ""public safety crisis"" on the reservation. The federal government countered in court documents that the tribe can't prove treaties force the government to provide the tribe with its ""preferred level of staffing or funding for law enforcement."" After two days of court proceedings last week, a judge said he would take the case under advisement.

""Sea-level rise is not only a threat in itself. It is a threat-multiplier,"" Guterres told a Security Council debate on ""Sea-level Rise: Implications for International Peace and Security."" Rising seas threaten lives, and jeopardize access to water, food and healthcare. Saltwater intrusion can decimate jobs and entire economies in key industries like agriculture, fishery and tourism, he said. It can damage or destroy vital infrastructure, and rising seas threaten the very existence of some low-lying communities and even countries, he added. Citing data released by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), Guterres said that global average sea levels have risen faster since 1900 than over any preceding century in the last 3,000 years. The WMO predicted that even if global heating is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius, there will still be a sizeable sea level rise, and if temperatures rise by 2 degrees Celsius, that level rise could double, with further temperature increases bringing exponential sea level increases. The consequences of the scenarios ""are unthinkable,"" Guterres said, warning that the world would witness ""a mass exodus of entire populations on a biblical scale"" and ""ever-fiercer competition for fresh water, land and other resources."" The international community must meet this rising tide of insecurity with action to address climate crisis, the root cause of rising seas, with more concerted action to reduce emissions and ensure climate justice, he said. Developing countries must have the resources to adapt and build resilience against climate disaster, the UN chief said, which means delivering on the loss and damage fund, making good on the 100-billion-U.S.-dollar climate finance commitment to developing countries, doubling adaptation finance, and leveraging massive private financing at a reasonable cost.

""This will cover a period of three months,"" Guterres told reporters, adding that ""we are in the final stages of a similar appeal for Trkiye."" The Syria effort brings together the entire UN system and humanitarian partners and will help secure desperately needed, life-saving relief for nearly 5 million Syrians, including shelter, healthcare, food and protection, Guterres said. ""The most effective way to stand with the people is by providing this emergency funding,"" he noted. Strong earthquakes and aftershocks hit Trkiye and neighboring Syria on Feb. 6, with the death toll climbing to over 35,000 people as of Monday. In the immediate aftermath of the earthquakes, the United Nations rapidly provided 50 million dollars through the Central Emergency Response Fund. ""But the needs are immense,"" Guterres said, pointing out that one week after the devastating earthquakes, millions of people across the region are struggling for survival, homeless and in freezing temperatures. ""We are doing all we can to change this. But much more is needed,"" he said. The UN chief stressed that the human suffering from this epic natural disaster should not be made even worse by manmade obstacles in access, funding and supplies. ""Aid must get through from all sides, to all sides, through all routes -- without any restrictions,"" he said. ""I urge member states and others to fully fund this effort without delay and help the millions of children, women and men whose lives have been upended by this generational disaster,"" said Guterres. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), 8.8 million people in Syria were affected by last week's devastating earthquakes. The damage is worse in the north-west of the country, where more than 4.2 million people have been affected in Aleppo, and 3 million people have been affected in Idlib, OCHA said Tuesday in a press release, adding that more than 7,400 buildings have been completely or partially destroyed. ""Water, electricity, heating and social services are under severe pressure. The risk of waterborne diseases is high, particularly amid an ongoing cholera outbreak,"" the UN agency said. ""Emergency health care is limited, and lack of fuel and heavy machinery is hampering efforts to quickly reach people most in need."" The UN funding appeal of nearly 400 million dollars will benefit 4.9 million people with the most urgent humanitarian needs, OCHA said. The appeal aims to provide essential shelter, health, food, water, sanitation, non-food items, education, nutrition and protection services, as well as carrying out essential light repairs and rehabilitation to restore health, water and sanitation, agriculture and education infrastructure, and supply chains. It also intends to support livelihoods by providing short-term employment for debris clearance and small-scale rehabilitation, provide protection services, mental health and psychosocial support, and gender-based violence case management, said OCHA.

251,Feature: Chinese rescuers race against clock in quake-hit Türkiye,"  ANKARA, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- Standing on the debris in the southern Turkish city of Malatya with fingers frozen in a temperature of minus seven degrees Celsius, Zhu Yanjun, a 49-year-old Chinese woman, was racing against time with her fellow members from the Blue Sky Rescue (BSR) team to search for signs of life. Soon after the twin earthquakes of 7.7 and 7.6 magnitudes hit Türkiye's southern part and devastated almost 10 provinces, Zhu signed up for rescue missions in the earthquake-ravaged region right away. It is Zhu's first mission abroad since she has joined the BSR team, a Chinese civil relief squad, in central China's Hunan Province in 2019. ""My father was a soldier and he is the person I respect the most. My dream of donning the uniform to help others finally came true,"" she said. Zhu, after joining rescue workers from other BSR teams in Wuhan, flew to Istanbul Airport on early Thursday, bringing endoscope cameras, radar life detectors, demolition and rescue equipment and other necessary resources. Then they flew to Malatya to carry out rescue missions.   ""Rescue operations in Malatya are urgent and complicated as over 200 buildings have collapsed,"" said Jin Can, a member of the Hunan BSR team. As soon as the Chinese team arrived, they were called to investigate the situation of all collapsed buildings so as to effectively make rescue plans. ""In order to put the radar life detectors at the furthest point in the debris, our team members often had to take off their coats and crawl into holes under the rubble,"" Jin said.   Chinese rescuers, including an 82-member Chinese rescue team, the BSR team and other Chinese civil relief squads, have managed to rescue at least six survivors so far. Overseas branches of Chinese companies are also lending a helping hand. Upon learning of the earthquake, Hunan enterprises Zoomlion and SANY Group made quick responses and participated in earthquake rescue efforts, which helped save many people trapped under the debris. The Zoomlion's subsidiary in Türkiye arranged several excavators and sent overnight a rescue team of engineers and drivers to quake-hit Hatay province. SANY Group also quickly carried out disaster relief operations. Within one day after the earthquake, three rescue teams were mobilized, along with dozens of excavators, cranes and service vehicles, to rush to the worst-hit areas. Printed on the boxes of supplies donated by SANY Group was a Turkish proverb ""Dost kara günde belli olur,"" which means ""A friend in need is a friend indeed."" To the Chinese friends who came to the rescue, local people showed an outpouring of gratitude. When Zhu worked on a ruin in Malatya, a senior local woman whose relatives had been missing, kept watching at the site. She gave a thumbs-up to the rescuers, and insisted on shaking hands with Zhu. Noticing that Zhu's fingers were frozen stiff, the old lady immediately unbuttoned her coat and tucked Zhu's hands under her arms to make them warm. ""I didn't expect her to do that at all. At that moment, I felt that love has no national boundaries,"" Zhu said.",Xinhua,2023-02-15 12:55
252,"Interview: Report on U.S. involvement in Nord Stream explosions fits 11 known facts, says U.S. scholar","   WASHINGTON, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- The recent report by a famed U.S. journalist on the involvement of the U.S. Navy in the Nord Stream explosions is ""credible"" and is consistent with several existing facts, a renowned scholar has said. American investigative journalist Seymour Hersh said last week on the U.S. portal Substack that the U.S. Navy was involved in the Nord Stream explosions. According to Hersh, a Pulitzer Prize winner, last June, the U.S. Navy divers, operating under the cover of a widely publicized mid-summer NATO exercise known as BALTOPS 22, planted the remotely triggered explosives that destroyed three of the four Nord Stream pipelines three months later. ""I have long hypothesized that the U.S. Government carried out this action, and Hersh's account adds to the likelihood of that hypothesis,"" said Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, in an emailed interview with Xinhua.   The professor has listed 11 facts corresponding to Hersh's report. First and second are ""the long-standing vociferous U.S. opposition to Nord Stream and the extensive record of U.S. covert operations against the infrastructure of other countries,"" he said. U.S. President Joe Biden last year publicly warned that in the event of a Russian military campaign, the United States would end the pipeline, declaring, ""I promise you we will be able to do it,"" said the economist. Fourth, U.S. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland warned in 2022 that Nord Stream ""would not move forward"" if Russia launches operations, he added. Moreover, ""very few countries, if any, other than the United States have the technical capacity to carry out such an attack without immediate detection,"" said Sachs.   He also listed Sweden's remarkable unwillingness to reveal the results of its own investigation into the explosions, and the silence in mainstream Western media regarding Hersh's report, as two facts that can explain his hypothesis. The eighth fact is that ""Western intelligence agencies have admitted that there is no evidence whatsoever that Russia carried out this act,"" he said. The celebration by U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who deemed the pipeline destruction a ""tremendous opportunity"" to wean Europe from Russian gas, and by Nuland, who called the damaged Nord Stream 2 ""a hunk of metal at the bottom of the sea,"" also add to the possibility of the United States orchestrating the destruction, said the professor. Lastly, Hersh's credible and detailed account has yet to be refuted other than possibly in minor details, he said.",Xinhua,2023-02-15 13:02
249,"Sadly, mass shootings are a daily affair in America","   WASHINGTON, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- Three people were killed and five others were injured in on-campus shootings at Michigan State University (MSU) Monday night, with the suspect found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said. According to MSU spokesperson Emily Guerrant, the first shots were fired inside a hall at 8:18 p.m. local time (0118 GMT) at the north end of campus, and gunshots were later heard at a nearby hall. ""This is a complete nightmare we are living tonight,"" Chris Rozman, interim deputy chief with MSU Department of Public Safety, was quoted by CNN. The tragedy was the 77th mass shooting in the United States in 2023, according to the Mass Shooting Tracker website, a crowd-sourced database of U.S. mass shootings. On Tuesday afternoon, the 78th mass shooting followed in Pennsylvania. Four students were injured to varying degrees. The suspect is still at large.   Since the start of the New Year, in just 45 days, there have been 78 mass shootings across the United States, or an average of 1.7 per day, leaving 129 dead and 294 wounded. Figures also showed that the number of mass shootings across the country has been rising sharply, from 339 in 2013 to 753 in 2022 -- more than double. Three weeks earlier, seven people died and one was critically injured in two shootings in the coastal northern California city of Half Moon Bay. Another 11 people were killed and at least 10 wounded in a shooting in Monterey Park in Southern California. Shooting tragedies are a daily affair in the United States, with many fearing they could be caught up in the next mass killing. ""We have the highest rates of gun deaths in the world. We have more guns than people ... We have more than one gun for every man, woman and child in America. That is insanity,"" Paul Cole Padilla, an educational administrator, told Xinhua. Many people blame mass shootings on race, but the reality is far more complicated. America's culture of violence runs deeper than skin color, and the single-minded focus on race won't solve anything, said Bill Maher, host of the HBO political talk show Real Time. The culture of violence in the United States manifests on various fronts. ""Can American culture rethink itself -- can it transcend its belief that enemies are always out there, needing to be obliterated,"" said Robert C. Koehler, a Chicago-based journalist and nationally syndicated writer, adding that violence presents itself in people's imaginations, games, movies and defense budget, as consequence-free, instantaneous and necessary.   Last month, U.S. President Joe Biden urged Congress to ""ban assault weapons once and for all."" Still, Republicans remain steadfast in supporting gun rights and oppose more restrictions on carrying firearms. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer in January outlined an agenda to prioritize enacting stricter gun laws, calling for universal background checks, safe storage laws and extreme protection orders to prevent potential risk, The New York Times reported. Although most Americans support more gun control laws, the efforts seem in vain. A viral image on social media sums up America's moral morass: ""mass shooting happened, media extravaganza, thoughts and prayers, social media gun debates, no one actually does anything, back to 'normal,' another mass shooting happens."" Gun control has become a political asset rather than a problem that needs fixing. ""Americans who oppose gun control are more likely to contact public officials about it and to base their votes on it,"" explained Matthew Lacombe, associate professor at Case Western Reserve University and former researcher at Barnard College. ""Many politicians believe that supporting gun regulation is more likely to lose them votes than to gain votes.""",Xinhua,2023-02-15 13:11
253,Shifting geopolitics amid Ukraine crisis,"  Before the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis in 2014, Russia-US competition was the main cause of global geopolitical conflicts. Since the end of the Cold War in the 1990s, the US has been fueling antagonism, conflicts and wars in different countries, and ""color revolution"" in many states around the world in order to maintain its global hegemony. Russia, as the successor state of the Soviet Union, was unable to continue the competition with the US on the global stage, hence it chose to retain its traditional influence in Eurasia and the Middle East. Therefore Ukraine became a key factor in the Russia-US competition in Eurasia. Regarding Russia as a bigger threat than China, the US has emphasized both cooperation and competition with China, so it could concentrate resources in winning the competition with Russia. After 2014, Ukraine's ties with Russia started souring as it veered toward the US-led West, becoming a bridgehead for the US-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization to more directly target Russia. After political upheavals and some regime changes, the disputes between the Ukraine-West combine and Russia led to the Russia-Ukraine conflict in February 2022. The conflict exposed the US' ambition to use Ukraine as a front to weaken Russia and reduce its influence in Eurasia. And the US took advantage of the Russia-Ukraine conflict to strengthen its hold over Europe and drive a wedge between Europe and Russia, and Europe and China. The Ukraine crisis, along with the change of power in China, Russia and the US, prompted the three major global powers to change their global strategies. The US no longer regards Russia as a major global power and primary threat, and its policy toward Russia has shifted from strategic competition to intensive efforts to ""suppress"" Russia. The 2022 US National Security Strategy labels China as ""America's most consequential geopolitical challenge"", and says Russia ""poses an immediate and ongoing threat to the regional security order in Europe and it is a source of disruption and instability globally but it lacks the across the spectrum capabilities of the PRC"". As such, the US has called on its NATO allies to continue combating Russia and stepped up its long-term strategy to contain China. Despite China repeatedly asserting it believes in resolving differences through dialogue and adheres to the policy of peace and cooperation, the US has accused China of backing Russia in the Ukraine crisis and even sanctioned some Chinese companies for doing business with their Russian counterparts. China is not a participant in the Ukraine conflict and wants Russia and Ukraine to end it soon. Yet the US deliberately links the Ukraine issue with the Taiwan question, when the fact is they are completely different. Washington is working hard to curb China's rise by creating tensions. Facing the conflict with Ukraine and sanctions from the West, Russia is seeking non-Western trade and economic partners and therefore, attaches greater importance to Sino-Russian strategic partnership of coordination, which Russian President Vladimir Putin praised on Dec 30, 2022. For China, in fact, both Russia and Ukraine are strategic as well as important cooperative partners in the Belt and Road Initiative. And the Russia-Ukraine conflict does not benefit anyone. Instead, it has harmed China's economic and cultural cooperation with both countries. In these difficult times, therefore, China should establish a global network of partnerships and promote the building of a new type of international relations. China considers international issues and relations on their own merits and conducts in accordance with its diplomatic principles and national interests. China's development policy is to promote win-win cooperation with other countries and help build a community with a shared future for mankind. China will not succumb to the US' diplomatic coercion on the Ukraine issue. In fact, it is working hard to prevent further deterioration of bilateral ties with the US, although it will not compromise even an inch of sovereignty and territorial integrity. China has exchanged views with the Kyiv government on the situation in Ukraine, provided humanitarian supplies for the country, and has been working with the international community to help resolve the Ukraine crisis. During a meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in November 2022, President Xi Jinping stressed that China supports Germany and the European Union to promote peace talks. China and Germany jointly opposed the use of threat or nuclear weapons in the Ukraine conflict. Later, in a meeting with US President Joe Biden, President Xi reiterated that China follows a policy of co-development and emphasized the importance of abandoning the zero-sum game. The relationship between China and Russia, on the other hand, is a strategic partnership of coordination but it's not an alliance. China proposed ""no limit, no forbidden zone, and no ceiling"" in developing China-Russia strategic cooperation and believes Sino-Russian cooperation has great potential, and hopes to continue developing good-neighborly, friendly and win-win cooperation. China-Russia ties have maintained a high level of cooperation thanks to the efforts of both sides. China has also reiterated that ""nonalignment, non-confrontation and non-targeting of any third party"" is the foundation of Sino-Russian ties, which was stressed, once again, by Foreign Minister Qin Gang during his meeting with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. Deepening cooperation in economic, trade, security and cultural fields, and the necessity to build a more just world order, by among other things, condemning hegemonism and power politics, have prompted China and Russia to strengthen cooperation. And the US, not able to accept this development, has created a ""new normal"" between the three powers, not only checking China and Russia's development, but also strengthening confrontations with the two countries. In the trilateral relations, it is foreseeable that China will mainly make active efforts to develop a stable and stronger strategic partnership of coordination with Russia, and make efforts to decrease trust deficit with the US. Thus, China can help boost global economic recovery and restore strategic stability.",China Daily,2023-02-15 13:50
198,"India's tax department raids BBC offices in Delhi, Mumbai","NEW DELHI, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- Income tax department officials in India Tuesday raided offices of the United Kingdom's national broadcaster British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in New Delhi and Mumbai, multiple media reports said. According to the reports, the income tax officials arrived at the BBC offices for searches. However, some reports quoting their sources said the tax officials carried out a ""survey"" over allegations of international taxation and transfer pricing irregularities involving the BBC. ""Documents were seized and phones and laptops of journalists were taken away,"" a local television news channel NDTV said. ""The offices will be sealed for the duration of the survey and employees have been asked not to share details with anyone else."" The NDTV report quoted the tax officials as saying this was a survey, not a search, and that the phones would be returned. ""We needed some clarifications and for that our team is visiting the BBC offices and we are carrying out a survey. Our officers have gone to check account books, these are not searches,"" said NDTV report. Another local media report quoting officials said they were looking into documents relating to the company's business operations in India. The raid came weeks after the BBC aired a two-part documentary series on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which touched up Modi's role in the 2002 Gujarat riots, who was the chief minister of the state then. India blocked the documentary film soon after its release last month by invoking emergency powers under information and technology laws, ordering social media companies to remove the series. India's top court last week rejected a request for a complete ban on the BBC in India over the documentary, calling the petition ""entirely misconceived"".",Xinhua,2023-02-15 15:19
197,Truth or dare: wealthy netizen's reward for Ohio chemical leak probe shows widespread skepticism of US media outlets,"  In a demonstration of public concern over the recent Ohio chemical leakage crisis, a wealthy netizen going by the name ""Parody Pelosi"" on Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media platform, has offered 100,000 RMB to any volunteer who will go to the site and report for 24 hours without protective gear. The volunteer's travel expenses will be covered, and they will be required to eat and drink locally, according to legal documents ""Parody Pelosi"" posted on Weibo. No information about ""Parody Pelosi,"" other than being an ""American Chinese,"" was provided. The internet user also stated they were furious since many netizens claim that the US media is not covering the catastrophe because it is not a big issue, and they will pay money to anyone who dares to attempt to cover it. The message quickly went viral, with at least two volunteers signing up for the expedition. On Weibo, ""Parody Pelosi"" congratulated the volunteers and said they had already sent the applicants a non-disclosure agreement and a waiver release form. The online farce comes days after a train derailment accident in Ohio that resulted in toxic chemicals being released into the environment. Though the accident has been impacting residents in the affected area for more than a week, American mainstream media outlets preferred to focus on the groundless ""Chinese balloon"" incident rather than the environmental disaster. US media outlets have only recently started paying attention to the incident, though many have been trying to downplay its severe consequences. Due to the mainstream media's hesitation to warn people and reveal the truth about the chemical leak, many nearby residents have taken their grievances online, claiming that the US government and the media are not listening to their voices. Linda Murphy, a resident of East Palestine, Ohio, told the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) that there were several dead fish floating at multiple locations. “That is what we bathe in. That’s what we drink. That’s what we cook with. And they could not reassure me that the water was safe to drink,” she said. Murphy is not the only person to accuse the US government and media outlets of failing to do their jobs.   “While they have everyone chasing UFOs, they're hiding the fact that Ohio is experiencing a Chernobyl tier disaster after a train derailment released toxic carcinogens into one of the most fertile areas in America. Journalists reporting on it are being arrested,” said US Twitter user BABS D. Neil Donahue, a professor of chemistry at Carnegie Mellon University in nearby Pittsburgh, told AP he worries that the burning could have formed dioxins, which are created from burning chlorinated carbon materials. “Vinyl chloride is bad, dioxins are worse as carcinogens and that comes from burning,” Donahue said. Dioxins are a group of persistent environmental pollutants that last in the ground and body for years and have been one of the main environmental problems and sources of controversy in the United States. According to the US National Transportation Safety Board, about 50 cars on a Norfolk Southern Railroad train, including 10 carrying hazardous materials, derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, on February 3. The train was transporting hazardous items, including chemicals and flammables. To avoid an explosion, enormous plumes of smoke, including vinyl chloride, phosgene, hydrogen chloride, and other gases, were expelled for days during a controlled release and burn.",People's Daily Online,2023-02-15 17:53
224,"Ohio derailment leads to long-term environmental, health, legal concerns","NEW YORK, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- Residents in and around the village of East Palestine, in the Midwestern U.S. state of Ohio, feared for their health and concerns have mounted about the environmental effect, after about 50 Norfolk Southern train cars, including 20 carrying hazardous materials, derailed on Feb. 3 on the outskirts of the village. No one was injured in the derailment that investigators said was caused by a broken axle. Fearful of a major explosion, authorities have carved out an evacuation zone and carried out a ""controlled release"" of toxic fumes to neutralize burning cargo inside some of the cars. ""Plumes of smoke, questions about dead animals, worries about the drinking water. A train derailment in Ohio and subsequent burning of some of the hazardous chemicals has people asking: How worried should they be?"" reported The Associated Press on Wednesday. Concerns about air quality and the hazardous chemicals on board the train prompted some village residents to leave, and officials later ordered the evacuation of the immediate area as fears grew about a potential explosion of smoldering wreckage.    Three days after the accident, authorities decided to release and burn vinyl chloride inside five tanker cars, sending hydrogen chloride and the toxic gas phosgene into the air. Vinyl chloride is associated with increased risk of certain cancers, and officials at the time warned burning it would release two concerning gases -- hydrogen chloride and phosgene, the latter of which was used as a weapon in World War I. According to the Associate Press report, environmental officials said that monitors detected toxins in the air at the site during the controlled burn and that officials kept people away until that dissipated. They said continuing air monitoring done for the railroad and by government agencies, including testing inside nearly 400 homes, hasn't detected dangerous levels in the area since residents were allowed to return. However, even in communities beyond East Palestine, some residents said they worry about long-term effects of even low-grade exposure to contaminants from the site. The village scheduled a town hall at the local high school Wednesday evening to hear questions from residents, whose concerns have included lingering smells, how to ensure accountability for the cleanup, and what to make of pets and livestock that have appeared ill or died since the derailment.    On Feb. 10, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said that about 20 rail cars were reported to have been carrying hazardous materials. Chemicals including vinyl chloride, butyl acrylate, ethylhexyl acrylate and ethylene glycol monobutyl ethers were ""known to have been and continue to be"" released to the air, surface soil and surface waters. On Feb. 12, the EPA, after monitoring the air, said it had not detected contaminants at ""levels of concern"" in and around East Palestine, although residents might still smell odors. The agency insisted that it had not detected vinyl chloride or hydrogen chloride, which could cause life-threatening respiratory issues. On social media and in news reports, some residents said that fish and frogs were dying in local streams and people have shared images of dead animals or said they smelled chemical odors around town. ""Residents of the area have complained of headaches and feeling sick since the derailment,"" reported The New York Times on Wednesday. Ten days after the derailment, Senator J.D. Vance, a Republican of Ohio, said in a statement on Twitter that it was a ""complex environmental disaster"" that would require long-term study. The Ohio EPA is working on a two-stage cleanup, starting with the removal of materials from the site before moving to an assessment for a remediation plan.    Residents have filed a federal lawsuit over the derailment along the Ohio-Pennsylvania line, seeking to force Norfolk Southern to set up health monitoring for residents in both states. The lawsuit filed on Feb. 9 by two Pennsylvania residents calls for the rail operator to pay for medical screenings and related care for anyone living within a 30-mile (48-kilometer) radius of the derailment to determine who was affected by toxic substances released after the derailment. The lawsuit is also seeking undetermined damages. Environmental regulators have been monitoring the air and water in surrounding communities, saying that so far the air quality remains safe and drinking water supplies have not been affected. While some residents have complained about headaches and feeling sick since the derailment, Norfolk Southern declined to comment on the lawsuit.",Xinhua,2023-02-16 08:11
199,Rescue teams continue to find survivors as quake relief enters 10th day in Türkiye,"  ANKARA, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- As the chance of finding survivors from last week's devastating earthquakes in southern Türkiye diminishes with each passing day, a few hopeful news of the rescue teams pulling victims alive out of the ruins are making the headlines on Wednesday. Cemile Kekec, a 74-year-old woman, was rescued on Wednesday after spending more than nine days trapped under the wreckage in the southern province of Kahramanmaras, the epicenter of the 7.7- and 7.6- twin earthquakes, according to the Demiroren News Agency. Images showed the rescuers happily hugging each other when the old woman was carried by a crane to the ambulance. She was taken under treatment for kidney problems, a common health issue of long-trapped quake survivors.   Another lucky survivor, who was identified as 42-year-old Melike Imamoglu, was rescued 222 hours after the disaster. When the woman was being carried to the hospital, she was shouting out her daughter's name, but rescuers only discovered the remains of her children and husband under the wreckage. Rescue teams from Türkiye and dozens of countries, including China, are still working around the clock to search for signs of life under the rubble. More than 8,000 people have been pulled out alive from the rubble, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday, adding another 81,000 injured have been discharged from the hospital. While the rescue operations continue to the 10th day, priority has been shifted to survivors' relief as tens of thousands are struggling to meet their basic needs such as accommodation in freezing temperatures. Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) has set up tent and container camps for thousands of families, but still many have difficulty taking shelter.   The massive quakes have impacted 10 provinces in Türkiye, which are home to nearly 13 million people. It has also affected transportation, energy, and access to food and drinking water in the region and has caused damage to the sanitation infrastructure. Turkish Medical Association warned that the quake-hit region has entered the most dangerous phase in terms of infectious diseases, underlining that the measures taken so far were insufficient. The association stressed that people in the disaster zone are having difficulty accessing toilets and bathrooms, which increases the risk of diseases. Last week's catastrophic earthquakes left at least 35,418 people dead in Türkiye, making it the deadliest such disaster in the country in the past century since a quake in the eastern province of Erzincan killed 33,000 people in 1939. The death toll is expected to rise further. AFAD official Orhan Tatar said on Wednesday that there was a fault displacement of up to 7.3 meters after the earthquake and a 400-km surface rift was formed, while the depths of the tremors varied between 8 meters and 10 meters. ""These were the biggest earthquakes we've experienced in the last 2,000 years. The earth's crust shook very severely for two minutes. There have been a total of 3,858 aftershocks so far. There have been 38 aftershocks of magnitude 5 to 6,"" he said at a press conference.   Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change Minister Murat Kurum tweeted that they determined that 50,576 buildings needed urgent demolition because they were heavily damaged. Turkish authorities launched investigations against the contractors whose buildings collapsed in the earthquake zone. Legal authorities, accompanied by experts, take iron and concrete samples from the wreckage. The semi-official Anadolu Agency reported that the number of arrested increased to 24 on Wednesday. The decision of suspending schools until March 1 across the 10 provinces is likely to be extended as education cannot continue until the damage assessment studies are completed at school buildings, Turkish Education Minister Mahmut Ozer said Wednesday. Meanwhile, Türkiye's stock exchange, Borsa Istanbul, reopened on Wednesday with the index soaring almost 10 percent after a five-day earthquake-related closure.",Xinhua,2023-02-16 08:29
196,"UN scales up relief efforts in quake-hit Syria, Türkiye","UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is rapidly scaling up its humanitarian relief efforts in areas of Syria and Türkiye affected by last week's devastating earthquakes with more aid delivery, and appeal for increase in funding and closer systemwide coordination. The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) has helped provide micronutrient supplements for 113,000 children under the age of five and 1,000 pregnant and lactating women for three months, Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said Wednesday while updating the world body's latest relief work. The World Food Programme (WFP) has been distributing ready-to-eat meals and other food items to displaced families across Aleppo, Hama, Latakia and Idlib provinces in Syria, Dujarric told reporters. The cross-border response continued Wednesday, with 30 trucks from WFP, carrying canned food and mattresses, crossing into northwest Syria through the Bab al-Hawa crossing. The International Organization for Migration also delivered shelter and non-food items through the Bab al-Salam crossing, he said. According to the spokesman, since Feb. 9, a total of 117 trucks crossed into northwest Syria, with 106 through the Bab al-Hawa crossing and 11 through the Bab al-Salam crossing. The UN said on Monday Syria decided to open two more crossing points of Bab al-Salam and Al Ra'ee from Türkiye to northwest Syria for an initial period of three months for the delivery of humanitarian aid. Before the earthquakes, Bab al-Hawa was the only crossing through which the UN aid was allowed to go into northwest Syria. Dujarric said WFP plans to send a further 40 trucks in the next couple of days, potentially using the new border crossings. WFP has resumed its regular food assistance program with the distribution of food baskets for 170,000 people in non-government-controlled areas in the northwest of Syria in addition to the provision of emergency food rations to 100,000 people since Feb. 6, the spokesman said. As a major move to scale up the relief operations, Guterres announced on Tuesday the world body was launching a humanitarian appeal for 397 million U.S. dollars for the people of earthquake-hit Syria. The effort brings together the entire UN system and humanitarian partners and will help secure desperately needed, life-saving relief for nearly 5 million Syrians, including shelter, healthcare, food and protection, Guterres said, adding that ""we are in the final stages of a similar appeal for Türkiye."" In the immediate aftermath of the earthquakes, the United Nations rapidly provided 50 million dollars through the Central Emergency Response Fund. ""We are doing all we can to change this. But much more is needed,"" Guterres said. In another effort to scale up UN response, Dujarric said the principals of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, which brings together the UN and its humanitarian partners, has declared a humanitarian systemwide scale-up for six months. ""This helps to ensure that we are collectively and operationally deploying all possible means and resources to urgently respond in the earthquake-impacted areas,"" he said. The Inter-Agency Standing Committee is a humanitarian coordination forum of the UN system. It brings together the executive heads of 18 organizations and consortia, with members from within and outside the United Nations, to formulate policy, set strategic priorities and mobilize resources in response to humanitarian crises.",Xinhua,2023-02-16 08:30
202,SCO chief comments on U.S. act of shooting down unmanned Chinese airship,"BEIJING, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Ming, secretary-general of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), said Wednesday that the United States violated the spirit of international law and international practice when it shot down an unmanned Chinese airship. Zhang made the remarks when answering a query concerning the unmanned civilian airship, which the U.S. Department of Defense shot down with missiles. Zhang said the Chinese government has explained several times that it was a civilian unmanned airship used for meteorological and other research purposes. Affected by climate factors, the airship deviated far from its planned course, a situation caused by force majeure. The U.S. Department of Defense said the airship would not pose a military or personal threat to ground personnel, yet the U.S. side insisted on using force to shoot down the airship -- a clear overreaction that violated the spirit of international law and international practice, Zhang said. He said the SCO has always maintained that all countries should abide by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, refrain from the use of force and the threat of using force, and resolve international disputes through peaceful means such as negotiation and consultation.",Xinhua,2023-02-16 08:47

200,AU Executive Council meeting kicks off with call for concerted efforts to realize continental aspirations,"  ADDIS ABABA, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- The 42nd ordinary session of the Executive Council of the African Union (AU) kicked off on Wednesday with a call for increasing efforts to deepen continental integration and toward realizing Africa's development aspirations. The meeting, comprising foreign affairs ministers from AU member states and runs from Feb. 15 to 16, is being held under the AU's theme of the year for 2023 ""The Year of AfCFTA: Acceleration of the African Continental Free Trade Area Implementation."" Addressing the executive council, chairperson of the AU Commission Mussa Faki Mahamat said the evaluation of the implementation of the first decade of the AU's 50-year continental development Agenda 2063 has shown that Africa is moving forward, yet the continent has a long way to go. ""The success of the implementation of the second decade (of Agenda 2063) will depend on the level of how we take into account the various obstacles, including the effectiveness and efficiency in the implementation of the decisions of the policy organs,"" he said. Faki called for continental efforts in order to strengthen the position of Africa at the multilateral level, and also to look at the shared values that can be better harnessed. The AU Commission chairperson also expressed concern over increasing peace and security threats as well as unconstitutional change of governments, which are some of the major continental challenges affecting Africa. United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) Acting Executive Secretary Antonio Pedro on his part called on African countries to exert concerted efforts towards the realization of the continental free trade area. ""The AfCFTA's continental market provides the economy of scale in manufacturing, leading to increased intra-Africa trade, eventually bringing supply chains closer to home and injecting a degree of self-sufficiency in essential products such as medicines, food and fertilizers,"" he said. He said the continental free trade pact, by providing more opportunities for women and youth, helps reduce inequality and poverty, and improve inclusion. Pedro, however, said 10 African countries are yet to ratify the agreement establishing the AfCFTA, which compromises the realization of the full aspirations of the free trade pact. ""Only through an accelerated and effective implementation of the AfCFTA can Africa build sufficient shock absorbers to build resilience,"" Pedro said. Ethiopian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Demeke Mekonnen, on his part, emphasized the crucial role that the AU and pan-African actors are playing in ensuring peace and security across the continent. He underscored the AU's role in bringing an end to the two-year conflict in Northern Ethiopia. ""Over the past two years, we are grateful to see that our faith in the African Union has been vindicated,"" Mekonnen said. ""Africans should lead their endeavor to silence the guns in Africa. We call for optimal use of our peace and security architecture. This will help us address the remaining challenges in conflict management, prevention and resolution,"" he added. The Executive Council meeting, which brings together foreign ministers of African countries at the AU Headquarters in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa, is expected to consider the draft agenda of the 36th Ordinary Session of the AU Assembly, slated to be held from Feb. 18-19.

203,Chinese engineers' rescue experience in Türkiye: Going out to save people,"As of Feb, 13, a rescue team set up by the Turkish subsidiary of China's construction machinery manufacturer Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science & Technology Co., Ltd. had helped rescue more than 30 people trapped under rubble after devastating twin 7.8-magnitude earthquakes shook southeast Türkiye on Feb. 6 local time. Huang Yunbing and Yu Ke, Zoomlion's two Chinese engineers working in the company's Turkish subsidiary, were among the members of the rescue team who left Istanbul for the earthquake-stricken Hatay Province of Türkiye with excavators and other heavy equipment on the evening of Feb. 6.   ""Although I'm not a professional rescuer, I think I should take part in the rescue operation. We have maintained frequent contacts with the local people, and they have been very friendly and warm to us,"" said Huang. ""We were among the first Chinese rescue forces to arrive at the quake-hit areas. Collapsed buildings could be seen everywhere, and the local rescue teams were in urgent need of heavy equipment for rescue operations. Our excavators were quickly sent to different sites,"" Huang recalled. ""Our job has been to clear the ruins. We use large machinery to clear a path through the debris so that professional rescuers can carry out their work and save people,"" Huang explained. In the quake-stricken areas, Huang and his teammates slept three to four hours a day in their construction trucks and ate at temporary supply points, where they were provided with porridge and water, according to Huang.   The team members went wherever they were needed, and the longest period of time they worked without any significant breaks was more than 30 hours, Huang said. ""Every time a survivor was rescued, the local people would put their right hand on their chest and bow to us to show their gratitude. The local children would also bring us snacks. These moments touched our hearts deeply,"" said Yu. Zoomlion's rescue team joined the China Search and Rescue team for rescue operations at noon on Feb. 11, said Huang, adding that they have also seen many other teams from China, including those from the Beijing Emergency Rescue Association, Green Boat Emergency Rescue, and Shenzhen Rescue Volunteers Federation (SRVF). Different rescue teams have been working closely on their tasks, according to Huang.   ""At noon on Feb. 10, after we rescued a middle-aged woman from the debris, local rescuers saw us and asked to borrow our life detector. There may have been another survivor under the rubble nearby, so they needed to use a life detector to locate the survivor before carrying out the next step of the rescue work. I immediately contacted the China Search and Rescue team, which was one kilometer away, and finally got two life detectors after communicating between multiple parties,"" Huang recalled. “There was another time when local people sought help from the SRVF, because a father and his baby were trapped under the debris. We and rescuers from the SRVF worked together to rescue them. Unfortunately, they were already dead when they were brought out of the debris. The father had been holding his baby under him. Although we had gone all out to save lives, we felt helpless on many occasions,"" Huang said. At 6:51 p.m. on Feb. 11 local time, Chinese and local rescue teams saved a boy from the debris through their joint efforts and carried him into an ambulance. At that time, it had been over 150 hours since the deadly earthquakes had struck, and the local temperature was low, which made it very difficult for the trapped people to survive.   ""It was a residential building that had completely collapsed. We had searched it many times a few days ago, and helped rescued 13 people from it. Rescuers had basically decided to move to other ruins,"" Huang said. ""But the boy’s two elder brothers stayed up by the collapsed building all night, and were convinced that he was alive. After Turkish military found signs of life in the building using life detectors, we started digging at 2 p.m., and after four hours, the boy was finally rescued. I was very excited at that moment,"" Huang recalled. On Feb. 13, Huang and Yu returned to Istanbul after seven consecutive days of rescue work at earthquake-stricken areas. The second group of Zoomlion engineers have now arrived at the scene and taken over from them. Rescue operations are still underway. ""So far, we don't plan to leave. We will stay to the end. We hope not to miss any miracle of life,"" said an executive of Zoomlion's subsidiary in Türkiye. Besides Zoomlion, many other Chinese companies operating in Türkiye have also quickly joined the frontline of the rescue operation and made active efforts to raise funds and donate medicines, food, heating equipment, and other emergency supplies for people affected by the disaster.

225,Feature: Chinese medical team helps Ghanaian patients restore sight,"  ACCRA, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- Elizabeth Dzokpe is a retired nurse from Kpando in the Volta Region of Ghana. She regained her vision this week thanks to the Chinese medical team in Ghana. ""I could not see well in the right eye, and sometimes, after taking a few steps, it felt like I was about to fall. I came to the hospital and was diagnosed with cataract,"" she told Xinhua in a recent interview. Cataract is a common cause of visual impairment. To restore sight, patients need to undergo surgeries, which are cost-involving, preventing low-income Ghanaians with cataracts from accessing treatment to restore their vision. The Chinese medical team stationed at the LEKMA Hospital in Accra, the capital of Ghana, has offered free surgeries since last November to restore the vision of Ghanaians suffering from cataracts. Dzokpe became one of the beneficiaries and has her vision regained after the free surgery on Monday. Cheng Zhixing, an ophthalmologist and member of the Chinese medical team, led his Ghanaian counterparts to perform phacoemulsification cataract surgeries to restore the sight of cataract patients. According to the medical team, more than ten cataract patients have regained sight due to the team's help since last November. Senam Aidam, head of the Ophthalmology Unit of LEKMA Hospital, lauded the Chinese medical team for the great work they have been doing at the hospital. ""I have been working with Doctor Cheng, and he has been helping me. I do the old type of surgery, which is manual small incision cataract surgery, but he has been assisting me with the phacoemulsification surgery,"" she said. ""We work together with the nurses, and it is teamwork, so it's been going on very well.""    ",Xinhua,2023-02-16 11:21
205,"Natural disasters, boosted by climate change, displaced millions of people in U.S. in 2022: survey","   NEW YORK, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- Natural disasters forced an estimated 3.4 million people in the United States to leave their homes in 2022, underscoring how climate-related weather events are already changing American communities, NBC News reported over the weekend, citing Census Bureau data collected earlier this year. The overwhelming majority of these people were uprooted by hurricanes, followed by floods, then fires and tornados. Nearly 40 percent returned to their homes within a week. Nearly 16 percent have not returned home (and may never do so), and 12 percent were evacuated for more than six months. ""These numbers are very distressing,"" Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, was quoted as saying. ""These numbers are what one would expect to find in a developing country. It's appalling to see them in the United States ... They're only going to get worse in the years to come because climate change is making extreme weather events more frequent and more severe."" Some states experienced far more of an impact than others. Louisiana and Florida had the most displacements in the country, when adjusted for population, with more than 888,000 in Florida and more than 368,000 in Louisiana displaced in 2022. The Census Bureau count is based on 68,504 responses it received as part of the Household Pulse Survey conducted Jan. 4 to 16. The data collection is one of the few federal efforts to track displaced people, starting only in 2020.

""The rise in cases has placed newborns at further risk of life-threatening harm in a state that's already home to the nation's worst infant mortality rate,"" said the report. In 2021, 102 newborns in Mississippi were treated for the sexually transmitted disease, up from 10 in 2016, according to an analysis of hospital billing data shared by Thomas Dobbs, the medical director for the Mississippi State Department of Health's Crossroads Clinic in Jackson, which focuses on sexually transmitted infections. ""This seems like something that should have happened a hundred years ago, not last year,"" Dobbs, who is also dean of the John D. Bower School of Population Health at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, was quoted as saying. ""There's really kind of a shock."" The Mississippi State Department of Health does not formally track congenital syphilis deaths but said there was at least one baby who died in 2021. Congenital syphilis occurs when the infection is passed from a mother to her child while she's pregnant. If untreated, a pregnant woman with syphilis has an 80 percent chance of passing it to her baby, according to the report.",Xinhua,2023-02-16 11:26
207,Health impacts of pollution questioned after train derailment in U.S.: Reuters,"LONDON, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- Residents and observers have questioned the health impacts of pollution after a train carrying toxic materials derailed in Ohio, the United States, more than 10 days ago, Reuters has reported. Reporters pressed Ohio Governor Mike DeWine and other officials about some residents' complaints of headaches and concern that the government or the railroad were not telling them the entire truth about the pollution and potential harm, said the Reuters report published Tuesday. The plume of pollution in the Ohio River is moving at about 1.61 km per hour toward the Mississippi River, nearing Huntington, West Virginia, on Tuesday afternoon, according to the report. However, DeWine had said the pollution did not pose a serious threat to 5 million people who rely on the river for drinking water. Railroad union officials said they have been warning that such an accident could happen because railroad cost-cutting harmed safety measures, said the report.

208,Killing of Tyre Nichols catalyst to root out racial injustice in U.S. policing: article,"   NEW YORK, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- The horrific killing of Tyre Nichols by several police officers in Memphis, a city in the U.S. state of Tennessee, is yet another searing reminder of the dangers of driving while Black in America, according to an article published on the Center for American Progress website last week. ""It has focused the national spotlight, yet again, on how police disproportionately stop Black drivers and, even worse, the alarming numbers of Black Americans who are killed while stopped for alleged traffic or other minor violations by the very officers sworn to keep us all safe,"" it noted. After almost three years of public outcry following the murder of George Floyd, far too little action has been taken to right the fundamental wrong of police policies and practices that focus more on surveilling, harassing, and intimidating Black people than on investigating and solving crime, according to the article. ""Without meaningful structural and cultural changes in policing, these atrocities will continue,"" it said, adding that police were responsible for killing 1,192 people last year, the highest number of deaths in the past decade. The rate of being killed by police is more than twice as high for Black people than for white people. During traffic stops alone, police have killed nearly 600 people since 2017, and Black drivers account for 26 percent of these deaths despite Black people making up only 13 percent of the population, it added.",Xinhua,2023-02-16 11:30

He was addressing journalists following a NATO defense ministers' meeting here to address key issues for their security. ""More countries are now spending at least two percent of their GDP on defense. And 2022 was the eighth consecutive year of increased defense spending by European allies and Canada. With an additional investment of 350 billion U.S. dollars, this trend is expected to continue this year. But more needs to be done,"" he said. NATO allies agreed in 2014 to move toward spending 2 percent of their GDP on defense by 2024.   He said the allies had agreed on the need to work hand-in-hand with the defense industry to ramp up industrial capacity because Ukraine, to which they were providing unprecedented support, was ""consuming an enormous quantity of allied ammunition and depleting our stockpiles."" He said the ministers had also discussed the security of critical undersea infrastructure following the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines. He announced the establishment of a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell within the NATO headquarters. The U.S. Navy has been accused in press reports of involvement in last September's attacks on the Nord Stream gas pipelines in the Swedish and Danish exclusive economic zones under the Baltic Sea, which were built to transport natural gas from Russia to Germany.

213,WHO says mpox still int'l public health emergency,"   GENEVA, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday that a widespread outbreak of the mpox (monkeypox) remained a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The WHO officially declared in July last year that the mpox outbreak outside of the traditional endemic areas in Africa had already turned into a PHEIC, the highest level of alert that the global health authority could issue. In a statement on Wednesday, the WHO said its experts acknowledged the progress in the global response to the mpox outbreak and a further decline in the number of reported cases during the last few months.   However, a few countries continued to see a sustained incidence of cases, while other regions were likely to have under-reporting of confirmed cases. The WHO committee of experts and WHO Secretary-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus have therefore both maintained that mpox remains an international public health emergency. The latest statistics from the WHO have shown that the current global risk of the mpox outbreak is assessed as moderate, while being reduced from moderate to low in the Region of South-East Asia. It also remains low in the Western Pacific Region. Meanwhile, the WHO said its preparedness and response plan against the mpox outbreak, which was launched in July 2022 to help guide coordinated public health action, would come to an end in June 2023. Two WHO regions, Europe and the Americas, which reported 95 percent of diagnosed cases, have maintained stable in case numbers during recent weeks. As of Feb. 3, 43 countries and territories had not detected any new cases in the past three months, the WHO European Region reported. The Region of the Americas has also reported a stable number of cases in the last six weeks, with 200 to 250 cases per week.  ",Xinhua,2023-02-16 13:12
186,U.S. Buffalo mass shooter sentenced to life in prison with white supremacy bashed,"  NEW YORK, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- The 19-year-old man Payton Gendron, who committed the mass shooting last May in Buffalo of the U.S. state of New York, was sentenced to life in prison without parole on Wednesday as expected while white supremacy got bashed at court. Erie County Court Judge Susan Eagan announced the sentence based on 10 counts of first-degree murder and a single count of domestic terrorism motivated by hate, which carries a penalty of life imprisonment without parole.  ""There is no place for you or your ignorant, hateful and evil ideologies in a civilized society. There can be no mercy for you. No understanding. No second chances. The damage you have caused is too great and the people you have hurt are too valuable to this community. You will never see the light of day as a free man ever again,"" said Eagan. Fueled by racist conspiracy theories, Gendron drove about three hours from his home to a Black-predominated community in Buffalo and shot multiple individuals in and around a Tops grocery store on May 14, 2022, which resulted in the deaths of 10 African Americans, as well as injury to three others. In November 2022, Gendron pleaded guilty to the highest charges in the indictment against him including one count of domestic act of terrorism motivated by hate in the first degree, ten counts of murder in the first degree, three counts of attempted murder in the second degree as a hate crime and one count of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree. Gendron was the first person in New York State convicted of that domestic terrorism charge, which was passed in 2020 and mandates life in prison without an opportunity for parole. Gendron made a brief apology on Wednesday, saying he was ""very sorry"" for the attack and blamed online content for the shooting rampage. ""Our client is responsible for committing this crime. He will spend the rest of his life locked away and he will eventually die in state prison. We hope that knowing that he will never be free again will offer some small bit of comfort to those that he's hurt so much,"" said Brian Parker, one of Gendron's attorneys, after the announcement of the sentence. Moreover, Gendron faces federal charges, which carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment or death penalty. A number of family members of the victims and survivors made victim impact statements at the court and the processing was once interrupted as a man charged the defendant in the courtroom.  ""Our black and brown brothers and sisters endured centuries, not years, centuries, of oppression as they built our buildings and produced our crops by which the foundation of this country was built on. They continue to endure oppression... They continue to endure micro aggressions. They continue to have their families gunned down simply because of the color of their skin,"" said Stephanie, sister of survivor Jennifer Warrington, who was injured in the shooting. Parker said this case highlights a much deeper problem and Gendron's violent, hate-filled assault was in part the product of centuries of pervasive racism, which needs to be addressed. ""This hateful act and other similar hateful acts across the country motivated by white supremacy and replacement theory are a reckoning for us as a nation. The ugly truth is that our nation was founded and built in part on white supremacy,"" said Eagan in the sentence. Eagan recounted white supremacy acts in U.S. history like the treatment of Native Americans by the first European settlers, the cruel, inhumane economic engine nation building practice of slavery, indentured servitude, Jim Crow laws, government policies creating segregated public housing with communities of color and many other social injustices. Eagan said, ""Our history is replete with both individual and systemic discriminatory practices, many of them still firmly in place today. In fact, it is these very policies and practices that contributed to and made this atrocity possible. The effects of these policies, some current and others, decades and centuries old, created the segregation in our city and enabled this defendant to research and identify his target to maximize the impact of his evil intent."" ""The harsh reality is that white supremacy has been an insidious cancer on our society and nation since its inception, and it undermines the notions of a meritocracy and the land of opportunity that we hold so dear. However, white supremacy is not inevitable or unstoppable. It has been carefully cultivated and nurtured by individuals and the government for centuries,"" added Eagan. ""Unfortunately, neither this proceeding, nor any criminal trial can expose or address the historical racism that set the stage for our client's horrible acts. We as a community need to have those conversations in our legislative bodies, in their living rooms to achieve any sort of meaningful change,"" said Parker. Stephanie stressed the beauty of diversity saying ""We are stronger together. Diversity makes us beautiful."" Parker noted that the racist hate motivating this crime was spread through online platforms, and the violence was made possible by the easy access to assault weapons. Eagan warned that ""we must acknowledge that history. See that history for what it is. Recognize it and learn from it. Or we are doomed to repeat it."" Eagan urged individuals to call out injustice in daily lives and reject racism in all of its forms.    ",Xinhua,2023-02-16 13:16

192,Feature: Chinese rescuers battle against odds at epicenter of quake-hit Türkiye,"ANTAKYA, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- International rescue missions rushed to Türkiye and Syria after massive earthquakes that struck the region last week left nearly 40,000 dead, tens of thousands injured and an unknown number trapped in the rubble. There are currently over 9,000 foreign nationals from over 80 countries conducting search and rescue operations and offering humanitarian assistance in the quake-hit zone, according to the Turkish foreign ministry. Among those who mounted extraordinary recovery efforts is an 82-member Chinese search and rescue team, which has so far pulled out six survivors from the rubble in a week, defying the odds. ""There are some differences between search and rescue at home and abroad,"" said Zhao Yang, a team member working in the Antakya district of the southern Hatay Province. ""First, we need a comprehensive picture of the situation from local authorities,"" he said. ""Second, we need to work with local emergency response teams and figure out how to overcome the language obstacle."" Finally, ""earthquake search and rescue missions require lots of resources, which need to be coordinated with local institutions,"" he added. Flying over 8,000 km on an Air China charter flight to southern Türkiye, the team arrived last Wednesday morning along with four rescue dogs and over 20 tons of equipment for rescue, communication and medical purposes, including life detectors that probe the rubble for signs of survivors. ""When search and rescue teams are on a mission in a foreign country, they face difficulties including acclimatizing to challenging local conditions, communicating with local personnel speaking different languages, and securing vehicles and equipment,"" said Zhao, adding that local volunteers have ""provided significant assistance."" Emir Kaan Karaman, a student volunteer living in Istanbul, was assigned by the country's disaster management agency as a translator for the Chinese team. ""They showed the same dedication as one would expect from a Turk, just like someone looking for their own family [beneath the rubble],"" Karaman said. ""They were giving their all, not just their technical knowledge but from their hearts.""",Xinhua,2023-02-16 14:17

194,Gun Violence in the United States: Truth and Facts,"BEIJING, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- Gun Violence in the United States: Truth and Facts Contents Introduction I. The Surge of Gun Violence in the United States II. Gun Control: An Uphill Battle in the United States III. Gun Violence Lays Bare the Decline of U.S. Governance Capacity Conclusion  Gun violence is a chronic disease in the United States. With its interplay with gun culture, individual rights, interest groups and partisan politics, it has long plagued American society and gravely violated people's right to life, leaving an indelible stain on the country's human rights record. Through facts and figures, this report sheds light on the alarming state of gun violence in the United States and the political and social causes of this entrenched problem.  Gun violence is one of the acutest social problems in the United States, with ramifications not only for the victims and their families, but also for the entire society and country. In addition to the casualties caused and the threat to public security, it has also resulted in enormous economic losses and social trauma for the nation. ◆ The United States is the country with the most civilian-held firearms. With less than 5 percent of the world's population, it accounts for 46 percent of global civilian gun ownership. As estimated by the Small Arms Survey in Switzerland, the global stockpile of civilian-held firearms has increased from 650 million in 2006 to 857 million in 2017, largely attributable to soaring figures in the United States. In 2017, about 393.3 million guns were privately owned in the United States at a time when its population was less than 326.5 million. This amounts to 120.5 firearms for every 100 people. The second-ranked country was war-torn Yemen, with 52.8 guns per 100 people. While the United States ranks first in the world in terms of both individual gun ownership and the number of guns per capita, only about 1.07 million civilian guns are registered, indicating that the vast majority of firearms owned by civilians are left unregistered and uncounted. ◆A latest study by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) reveals that the United States is in the midst of a massive gun-buying boom that shows no signs of abating. From 2000 to 2020, annual production of firearms in the country almost tripled, with a dramatic increase in the past three years in particular. Since 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about more social problems. The ""Black Lives Matter (BLM)"" movement sparked a series of looting and riots, aggravating social insecurity. As a result, demand for semi-automatic pistols for self-protection surged and gun sales soared at a record pace. According to the U.S. National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), the United States conducted 21 million background checks for gun purchases in 2020, a 60 percent increase from 2019 and a record high, surpassing the previous record in 2016 by 5.3 million. The sudden first-time gun ownership by millions of Americans has inevitably given rise to considerable security threats. ◆Individual ownership of a large number of guns has triggered incessant violence, putting social security in the United States at greater risk. As pointed out by some American scholars, gun-related deaths in the United States in one week may exceed those in the whole Western Europe in one year. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the firearm homicide rate in the United States reached its highest level since 1994. According to a survey by the Giffords Law Center, 32 of the country's 50 largest cities witnessed a prominent increase in firearm homicides in 2021. The Guardian reported in October 2021 that every 16 hours, a woman is fatally shot by her partner in the United States. According to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), from 2018 to 2021, the proliferation of guns not only resulted in a spike in homicides across the country, but also led to more suicides by people with mental illnesses. According to the Gun Violence Archive (GVA), gun-related casualties surged to 85,584 in 2021 from 34,231 in 2014. Among the nearly 95,000 homicides between 2015 and 2019, about 74 percent were committed with firearms. In 2020, firearm-related deaths reached 45,222, an average of 124 per day. Firearm injuries are one of the top five causes of death for people aged 1 to 44 in the country. ◆Recent years have witnessed frequent mass shootings in the United States, causing alarmingly high casualties. By American standards, a mass shooting is defined as an incident of gun violence in which four or more people are injured or killed, excluding the suspect or the gunman. According to GVA data, both mass shootings and deaths in the United States have surged about fourfold since 2013. There were 417 mass shootings in the country in 2019, 611 in 2020, and 692 in 2021. In 2022, there were 213 mass shootings reported in 34 states and the capital Washington, D.C. by the end of May, with 242 killed and 912 wounded, a 50 percent increase over the same period in 2017 and a 150 percent increase over the same period in 2013. On July 4, 2022, Independence Day of the United States, a 21-year-old white man fired more than 50 shots from a rooftop at a parade in Highland Park, a suburb north of Chicago, killing at least seven people and injuring more than 30. On Jan. 21 and 23, 2023, tragic shootings occurred in Monterey Park of Los Angeles County, California and Half Moon Bay in northern California, killing 17 and injuring 11. ◆The United States has seen repeated mass school shootings for many years, causing serious trauma to the American society. The mass shooting at the Columbine High School in Colorado in April 1999 killed 13 people and left more than 20 injured. In April 2007, the shooting at Virginia Tech resulted in the death of 32 students and faculty members. GVA data show that, over the past decade, 27 mass school shootings took place in the United States. The deadliest shootings among them are: December 2012, Connecticut, Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, 26 killed including 20 children aged six to seven; October 2015, Roseburg, Oregon, Umpqua Community College shooting, 10 killed; February 2018, Parkland, Florida, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, 17 killed (14 students and 3 faculty members) and 17 injured; May 2018, Houston, Santa Fe High School shooting, 10 killed. In May 2022, an 18-year-old gunman entered the Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, and killed 21 people including 19 children. This last incident was the 27th school shooting in the United States in 2022. It was also one of the worst in recent years. ◆Gun violence also inflicts huge economic losses. According to Brady, an organization that advocates gun control, gun violence costs the U.S. economy at least 229 billion U.S. dollars each year. In May 2022, in the wake of the shooting at the Robb Elementary School in Uvalde County, Texas, over 200 CEOs co-signed a letter urging the U.S. Senate to take immediate actions to address gun violence. In the letter, it was stated that ""gun violence costs American taxpayers, employers and communities a staggering 280 billion U.S. dollars per year"". ◆Gun violence has also taken a toll on the everyday life of the American people. A poll conducted by the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 21 percent of American adults have experienced gun violence in which their relatives, friends or themselves have been threatened with a gun or have fallen victim to a shooting. As many as 54 percent of black and hispanic Americans say that they have had similar experience. The Associated Press reported a survey by the American Psychological Association (APA), which shows that one-third of American adults feel they cannot go anywhere without worrying about being a victim of a mass shooting, and nearly a quarter of them admit that they have changed their behavior due to fear of mass shootings.  Since the end of the 19th century, U.S. state and local governments have made various attempts to introduce legislation on gun control, but such efforts all ended up either long in words but short on action, or flip-flopped. No real progress was made on gun control. ◆The second amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides for the right of individuals to keep and bear arms. In recent years, as gun-related issues have become increasingly prominent, pro-gun and pro-control advocates have engaged in heated debates on the interpretation of the second amendment. Organizations that support gun rights claim that individual rights should not be arbitrarily modified and gun control is illegal. Organizations that support gun control argue that the second amendment establishes a collective right, rather than an individual right to possess guns, and the government has the right to control guns. Such debates have resulted in stalled efforts on gun control legislation, and Supreme Court rulings based on the second amendment are often not in favor of gun control. ◆In the United States, there is significant disparity in gun control from state to state, and relevant legislation efforts at the federal level are often slow, inconsistent and contradictory. In 1927, an act passed by Congress banned mail shipment of firearms such as pistols and revolvers to individuals, but did not prohibit the delivery of such firearms through private delivery firms. Under this act, individuals are allowed to buy guns across state lines. In 1968, the Gun Control Act passed by Congress did not include registration and licensing requirements for all firearms and their carriers, nor did it ban the import of firearm components. In 1969, the lobbying power of the U.S. National Rifle Association (NRA) propelled Congress to waive requirement for registration of buyers' information by sellers of shotgun and rifle cartridges. In 1986, the Firearms Owners' Protection Act signed by President Ronald Reagan made it easier for unlicensed individuals to sell firearms. It also allowed firearms to be sold at gun shows, and banned the establishment of any comprehensive system of firearm registration. ◆In 2005, Congress passed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which protects firearm manufacturers from civil liability for crimes committed with their products. Pro-gun groups have also used legislation and federal courts to resist gun control efforts. In June 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in the case of District of Columbia v. Heller. With this ruling, the District of Columbia lifted the ban on handguns and allowed individuals to keep guns at home. Justice Antonin Scalia, who presided over the case, noted that the second amendment protects an individual's right to keep and bear firearms, and that the District of Columbia's ban on handgun possession in the home violated that right. The Supreme Court's ruling and its opinion on this case have directly affected gun control legislation across the United States. In 2012, in the wake of a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary school, Senators Joe Manchin and Patrick Toomey drafted a compromise bill to expand background checks on gun buyers. The bill fell short of the 60 votes required to move forward and was thus defeated. In the ensuing decade, all congressional efforts to pass bills to enhance background checks on gun buyers ended up in failure. ◆In March 2021, the House passed the ""Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021"", which requires background checks on all gun sales. In May 2022, two mass shootings in Buffalo, New York and Uvalde, Texas sparked hundreds of anti-gun violence demonstrations, and calls for gun control re-surged. The Senate and the House adopted new gun control legislation, only after Democrats significantly weakened the control measures. At the same time, however, the Supreme Court issued a ruling striking down New York State's 1911 law which restricts carrying a concealed firearm in public. This directly undermined the ability of state and local governments to monitor firearms in New York, California, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts and New Jersey, among others. ◆Due to the difficulty of Congress to act on gun control, the U.S. administration could only regulate certain types of firearms and firearm modifications through presidential executive orders. In June 2022, Congress passed a gun-related bill called the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. According to a Pew poll, most people are not optimistic about the bill's effect in reducing gun violence in the United States. Seventy-eight percent think it will do little, of which 36 percent think it will do nothing at all. ◆The American public is deeply divided on gun control. Public opinion polls in recent years have shown that women, urban residents, non-native borns, liberal-leaning people and non-gun owners are more likely to support gun control, while men, rural residents, native-born Americans, political conservatives, hunters and gun owners oppose it. The gap between Americans' stance on gun control is still widening.  Given a political system where different sides hold each other back, an increasingly polarized political ecosystem, pervasive interest groups and ineradicable racial discrimination, gun control in the United States is in stalemate, and a total ban on guns is effectively a mission impossible. ◆How the U.S. political system is designed and operates constitutes the root cause of ineffective gun control. Gun control intensity varies across different states, making it increasingly difficult to regulate guns and perform interstate enforcement. Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group, compared gun policies across the country, rating every state on the strength of its gun laws and comparing it with its gun violence occurrence. A positive correlation was found between ineffective gun control and gun violence rate. Eight states, including California and Hawaii, with comparatively well-established gun laws saw relatively low gun violence rates, while the 13 states with the weakest gun control, including Texas, Alaska and Missouri, have nearly three times as many gun deaths as the eight states mentioned above. ◆Positions of Democrats and Republicans on gun control are becoming increasingly polarized. In 1968, the House voted 305-118 and the Senate 70-17 to pass the Gun Control Act. Since then, the two parties have been increasingly divergent over gun control. Republicans have always supported gun ownership, while Democrats have unequivocally supported gun control. Given the polarized U.S. political landscape at present, it is even more difficult for either party to compromise. The New York Times reported that since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook, despite a Democratic push for gun control, 14 Republican-controlled states have gone the opposite way, passing laws allowing their citizens to carry guns without any licensing process. The Washington Post reported that in recent years, the Republican Party has posted a myriad of pictures and videos containing guns in newspapers, billboards and social media to appeal to voters who oppose gun control for campaigning purposes. ◆Interest group lobbying is rampant. Group politics and electoral politics in the United States have provided legalized channels for gun groups to conduct money politics and influence the stance of Congress members on guns. According to OpenSecrets statistics, from 1990 to 2022, gun ownership groups contributed 69.3 million U.S. dollars to federal and state candidates, while gun control groups contributed 51.6 million U.S. dollars. From 1998 to 2022, gun ownership groups spent 190.4 million U.S. dollars on lobbying, while gun control groups spent 28.9 million U.S. dollars. In the 117th Congress, 262 members have been sponsored by the NRA, among which 19 have each received more than 1 million U.S. dollars cumulatively. The vast majority of them are Republicans. Meanwhile, the NRA has spent handsomely against pro-gun control lawmakers. All five of the lawmakers whom the association has paid millions of dollars to oppose are Democrats. ◆Gun violence is exacerbated by long-standing social problems in the United States such as social inequality and racial tensions. Research shows that blacks are much more likely to encounter gun murder than whites, and half of all gun murder victims are black. In 2010, 14.6 out of 100,000 blacks were murdered, compared with 1.9 for whites. According to research by the CDC, between 2019 and 2020, gun homicides nationwide rose from 14,392 to 19,350, with the occurrence rate up from 4.6 to 6.1 per 100,000 people, a 34.6 percent increase. Of the 90,498 gun-related deaths in 2020 and 2021, 38,796 were murders, among which nearly 21,000 involved young black males.  The right to life is the biggest human right. The Declaration of Independence begins with the statement that life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are unalienable rights. One gunshot after another have shattered the American Dream that all men are endowed with the unalienable rights to life and liberty, and lead people to reflect deeply on where the American-style human rights really are. Some U.S. politicians have long treated the American people's right to life with indifference. Faced with growing gun proliferation, they have done nothing more than empty talks and prolonged debates, while pointing fingers at the human rights conditions of other countries. The most important thing that they are duty-bound to do is face up to and address their own problems, and let the American people enjoy true freedom from the fear of gun violence.",Xinhua,2023-02-16 15:33
215,Why is the West reticent about a report on U.S. involvement in Nord Stream explosions?,"BEIJING, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- A few months after the explosions of the Nord Stream gas pipelines shocked the world, some in the West who had rushed to blame Moscow have fallen silent in the wake of a U.S. investigative journalist's disclosure that Washington was the culprit of the blasts. In an article published last week on the U.S. portal Substack, Pulitzer Prize winner Seymour Hersh revealed that the United States partnered with Norway in a top-secret operation in June 2022 to plant remotely triggered explosives that took out three of the four Nord Stream pipelines three months later. Asked for a comment on Hersh's report, Adrienne Watson, a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, called it ""false and complete fiction."" Norway's foreign ministry also said it's ""nonsense."" None of the prime minister's office, defense and justice authorities of Denmark, one of the investigators into the pipeline destruction, replied to Xinhua's requests for comment. Experts believe that the West is secretive because any confirmation of Hersh's allegations will wreck U.S. relations with Germany and Europe, as the loss of cheap gas from Russia is dealing a severe blow to the bloc's economy.  Nord Stream comprises a pair of offshore natural gas pipelines, each made up of two pipes, running under the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany. The combined capacity of the four approximately 1,200-km-long pipes reaches 110 billion cubic meters per year of natural gas. In September 2022, the pipelines experienced multiple large pressure drops to almost zero, attributed to three underwater explosions in international waters, rendering three pipes inoperable.   Demark, Germany and Sweden were investigating the destruction, but all remain tight-lipped over who blew holes in the pipelines. Last December, a European official told The Washington Post, ""there is no evidence at this point that Russia was behind the sabotage,"" echoing the assessment of 23 diplomatic and intelligence officials in nine countries the Post had interviewed. In his blog post released on Feb. 8, Hersh said, citing sources, that after U.S. Navy divers planted C-4 explosives targeting the pipes in June 2022 under the cover of a widely publicized mid-summer NATO exercise known as BALTOPS 22, a Norwegian Navy P8 surveillance plane on Sept. 26 made a seemingly routine flight and dropped a sonar buoy. The signal spread underwater, initially to Nord Stream 2 and then to Nord Stream 1. A few hours later, the explosives were detonated, and pools of methane gas could be seen spreading on the water's surface in minutes, Hersh recounted. The U.S. decision ""to sabotage the pipelines came after more than nine months of highly secret back and forth debate inside Washington's national security community about how to best achieve that goal. For much of that time, the issue was not whether to do the mission, but how to get it done with no overt clue as to who was responsible,"" the report said. The journalist believes the United States had the motive, the opportunity and the ability. From the very start, Nord Stream 1 was seen by Washington and its NATO allies as a threat to Western dominance. ""Nord Stream 1 was dangerous enough in the view of NATO and Washington, but Nord Stream 2 ... would, if approved by Germany regulators, double the amount of cheap gas that would be available to Germany and Western Europe,"" he elaborated. On Feb. 7 last year, before the flare-up of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, U.S. President Joe Biden told a White House press conference in the presence of visiting German Chancellor Olaf Scholz that in the event of a Russian military campaign, ""there will be ... no longer a Nord Stream 2. We will bring an end to it."" ""I promise you, we'll be able to do it,"" he stressed.   Such ""indirect references to the attack"" made those involved in the operation planning dismayed. ""The plan was for the options to be executed post invasion, and not advertised publicly. Biden simply didn't get it or ignored it,"" Hersh wrote, citing a source with knowledge of the mission. Following Hersh's coverage, Russia, which had repeated its calls for an international probe into the incident but was excluded by the West from such efforts, accused European countries of trying to hide their investigation results and covering up who was to blame. On Feb. 9, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Hersh's work was ""serious"" and filled with ""deep analysis,"" but ""the article was not widely disseminated in the Western media, which cannot but cause our surprise."" ""This was a very dangerous precedent. If someone committed it once, he can do it anywhere in the world for a second time,"" he said. ""There are not many countries that can commit such sabotage.""  Hersh's disclosure has become an ""elephant in the room"" as the Western media have fallen into silence in solidarity over the issue. On Saturday, the journalist told the podcast Radio War Nerd the entire international pipeline industry knew ""who did what,"" and this was a reality that ""nobody thinks about."" When a handful of Western news outlets reported Hersh's revelation, they underlined him as ""no stranger to controversy"" to downplay his findings. Speaking to the podcast, Hersh suggested media colleagues who criticized him for using anonymous sources in his report ""understand the business better."" Hersh is widely celebrated for his journalism, which uncovered the 1969 My Lai massacre by U.S. troops in Vietnam and helped expose the U.S. abuses of Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad in 2004. ""It's amazing to me how they fall in line, my colleagues,"" he said, lamenting many mainstream U.S. outlets such as The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN become a front for the White House.   Meanwhile, multiple respectable scholars hold a favorable view of Hersh's report. Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, deems Hersh's report ""credible"" and consistent with existing facts, citing ""the long-standing vociferous U.S. opposition to Nord Stream and the extensive record of U.S. covert operations against the infrastructure of other countries."" ""Very few countries, if any, other than the United States have the technical capacity to carry out such an attack without immediate detection,"" he told Xinhua via email. ""Hersh's fine analysis tells how the destruction was planned and done but the conclusion is unsurprising. The United States, with very important Norwegian assistance, committed the crime against a friendly, allied country, Germany, and other (countries in) Europe,"" said Jan Oberg, director of the Transnational Foundation for Peace and Future Research. Calling the destruction ""a U.S. economic war on (its) submissive allies,"" Oberg told Xinhua, ""together with ill-considered, never-ending economic sanctions, the blow-up of Nord Stream has already caused enormous, accumulating harm to European citizens' economy."" Several observers opine that Hersh's findings would hardly raise concern in the West or push Western countries to uncover their investigation results. ""Even if the Germans, Swedes or Danes themselves found some evidence of U.S. involvement in the explosions, they would hardly talk about them because they would not be able to take such responsibility,"" said Igor Yushkov, a leading analyst of Russia's National Energy Security Fund. The investigators are hiding information that could bring far-reaching consequences for their relations with the country directly behind the explosions, said Vladislav Belov, deputy director of the Institute of Europe of the Russian Academy of Sciences.",Xinhua,2023-02-17 08:17
214,Firefighters battling massive fire in Florida,"  WASHINGTON, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- Firefighters are working to contain a massive fire in Kissimmee, in the southeastern U.S. state of Florida, on Thursday. The fire broke out at a nursery in the early hours of Thursday, involving more than two acres worth of pallets holding plastic planters, according to emergency authorities. The pallets at the nursery retail outlet are outdoors, and firefighters are trying to protect the outlet's building from the blaze. The Osceola County Fire Rescue and EMS said on Thursday noon that ""75 firefighters and 21 vehicles continue working to contain the fire entirely, with it expected to be fully contained in the next hour or so."" ""We estimate an additional couple of hours of overhaul as there's quite a large mess of melted plastic, etc.,"" the agency also updated. Video footage circulating on social media showed flames and plumes of thick, black smoke rising in the air. Crews have established air monitoring devices and are prepared to issue evacuation orders, if necessary, officials said. No injuries have been reported so far. The nursery is located about 21 kilometers from Walt Disney World, an entertainment resort complex near the cities of Orlando and Kissimmee.  ",Xinhua,2023-02-17 08:28
216,UN continues cross-border aid delivery to Syria,"UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- The world body is continuing its cross-border aid delivery into Northwest Syria in the aftermath of the massive earthquakes, said a UN spokesman on Thursday. Twenty-two trucks carrying aid from the World Food Programme and the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) crossed the Bab Al-Hawa crossing from Türkiye, said Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Two additional trucks carrying tents provided by the UNHCR crossed the Bab Al-Salam crossing. In Northwest Syria, shelter needs are the top priority among displaced people, he said. The Bab Al-Hawa crossing point was authorized by the UN Security Council for cross-border aid delivery into Northwest Syria.   After the Feb. 6 earthquakes, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad decided to open the two crossing points of Bab Al-Salam and Al Ra'ee from Türkiye to Northwest Syria for an initial period of three months to allow for the timely delivery of humanitarian aid. Dujarric said many homes had collapsed in the aftermath of the earthquakes. As of Tuesday, more than 8,900 buildings had been destroyed or damaged in Northwest Syria, leaving 11,000 people homeless. Other priorities, obviously, in addition to shelter needs and food, are cash assistance and supplies to cope with the harsh winter weather conditions, he said.",Xinhua,2023-02-17 08:36

218,Expert: Facts support pipeline blasts theory,"WASHINGTON — The recent report by a renowned journalist in the United States on the involvement of the US Navy in the Nord Stream explosions is credible and is consistent with several facts, an academic has said. Investigative journalist Seymour Hersh said last week on the US portal Substack that the US Navy was involved in the Nord Stream explosions. Hersh, a Pulitzer Prize winner, said that in June US Navy divers, operating under the cover of a widely publicized mid-summer NATO exercise known as Baltops 22, planted the remotely triggered explosives that destroyed three of the four Nord Stream pipelines three months later. ""I have long hypothesized that the US government carried out this action, and Hersh's account adds to the likelihood of that hypothesis,"" said Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University in New York, in an email. Sachs has listed 11 facts corresponding to Hersh's report. First and second are ""the longstanding vociferous US opposition to Nord Stream and the extensive record of US covert operations against the infrastructure of other countries"", he said. US President Joe Biden last year publicly warned that in the event of a Russian military campaign in Ukraine, the US would end the pipeline, declaring: ""I promise you we will be able to do it,"" Sachs said. Fourth, the US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland warned last year that Nord Stream ""would not move forward"" if Russia launched operations, Sachs said. Moreover, ""very few countries, if any, other than the United States have the technical capacity to carry out such an attack without immediate detection"". He also listed Sweden's remarkable unwillingness to reveal the results of its own investigation into the explosions and the silence in mainstream Western media regarding Hersh's report as two facts that can explain his hypothesis. The eighth fact is that ""Western intelligence agencies have admitted that there is no evidence whatsoever that Russia carried out this act"", he said.  The celebration by the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who called the pipeline destruction a ""tremendous opportunity ""to wean Europe from Russian gas, and by Nuland, who called the damaged Nord Stream 2 ""a hunk of metal at the bottom of the sea"", also increase the possibility that the US organized the destruction, Sachs said.

220,"Report reveals facts, truth of US gun violence: mission impossible exposes country's declining governance capacity","  China on Thursday released a report revealing the truth and facts of the rampant US gun violence, displaying that the US is in the midst of a massive gun-buying boom that shows no signs of abating and frequent mass shootings that have scared US society with alarmingly high casualties. Moreover, the US government's inability to address the ""mission impossible"" has laid bare the decline of US governance capacity. The report, titled ""Gun Violence in the United States: Truth and Facts,"" was released by Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on its website. It pinpointed several facts to highlight the severity of US gun violence. The US is the country with the most civilian-held firearms. With less than 5 percent of the world's population, it accounts for 46 percent of global civilian gun ownership. In recent years, driven by its simmering domestic conflicts such as racial problems, the US is in the midst of a massive gun-buying boom that shows no signs of abating. The report quoted data from the US National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), showing that the country conducted 21 million background checks for gun purchases in 2020, a 60 percent increase from 2019 and a record high, surpassing the previous record in 2016 by 5.3 million. The sudden first-time gun ownership by millions of Americans has inevitably given rise to considerable security threats. It also said that recent years have witnessed frequent mass shootings in the US, causing alarmingly high casualties. In the most recent case, a gunman opened fire on Monday at Michigan State University's main campus in East Lansing, killing three people and injuring five. Two Chinese students were among the five injured, Chinese Consulate General in Chicago said on Wednesday. Michelle Gong, a Chinese student at that university, said that ""immediately after the shooting, the teacher led us to hide in a big classroom and turned all the lights off. We were hiding under desks for four or five hours as the shooter was still wandering freely."" The gunman was later confirmed dead, from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot. After this incident, the governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, denounced gun violence as the ""uniquely American problem."" While US politicians made emotional calls to end gun violence, Chinese observers questioned how much Democrats could advance legislation, or if the topic would be used to attack opponents and stage another hypocritical political performance in wooing more voters for the upcoming elections. Some observers indicated that the chance of meaningful legislation on gun control remains grim, when the problem is triggered by the country's systemic failure. Diao Daming, associate professor at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times that the frequent mass shooting incidents in the US show that the COVID-19 outbreak made American society much more divided, with a growing numbers of issues such as surging inflation and failing governance, and more social problems have accumulated, so guns have become an outlet for people's emotions and dissatisfaction. It is like a vicious circle. More gun violence will propel more people to buy guns, and the more people buy guns, the more benefits that gun and weapons-related companies gain. Thus, they are more willing to lobby the government against introducing laws against gun control, said Wei Nanzhi, a research fellow of the American Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The vicious circle led to only one result, that is, it is less possible for the government to make any effective effort to control guns, according to Wei. The report also echoed those experts' views, saying that given a political system where different sides hold each other back, an increasingly polarized political ecosystem, pervasive interest groups and ineradicable racial discrimination, gun control in the US is in a stalemate, and a total ban on guns is effectively a mission impossible. Faced with growing gun proliferation, some US politicians have done nothing more than engage in empty talk and prolonged debates, while pointing fingers at the human rights conditions of other countries, said the report. It noted that the most important thing that they are duty-bound to do is to face up to and address their own problems, and let the American people enjoy true freedom from the fear of gun violence.",By Zhao Yusha (Global Times) ,2023-02-17 08:54
223,"IFRC triples emergency funding appeals for Syria, Türkiye","  BEIRUT, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) on Thursday increased its emergency funding appeals from 200 million Swiss francs (about 216 million U.S. dollars) to 650 million to respond to the rising humanitarian needs in quake-hit Syria and Trkiye. ""IFRC will offer 450 million Swiss francs to Trkiye and 200 million Swiss francs to Syria,"" IFRC's Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told a press conference held at the Beirut airport following his visit to Syria and before leaving for Trkiye. Chapagain described the reality in the two quake-hit countries as a tragedy, especially in the Syrian region of Aleppo. The tragedy has been exacerbated by the lack of fuel, electricity, and dilapidated infrastructure, he said.

221,Public not reassured about US derailment,"For days, authorities have been telling residents of the area around East Palestine, Ohio, in the United States that it is safe to return home after a 150-car train carrying hazardous chemicals derailed on Feb 3. However, concerns remain among the public that the government or railroad is not telling them the entire truth about the pollution or potential harm. About 50 cars, including 10 carrying hazardous materials, derailed in the fiery crash, which investigators said was caused by a broken axle. After hundreds of residents evacuated their homes, emergency crews conducted a ""controlled burn"" of the chemicals on Feb 6 to avert a possible explosion, but the operations were said to have discharged toxic and potentially deadly fumes into the air. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources said the chemical spill had killed an estimated 3,500 small fish along 12 kilometers of streams as of Feb 8. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine said on Tuesday that the pollution didn't pose a serious threat to the 5 million people who rely on the Ohio River for drinking water. However, he and several Ohio health and environmental officials cautioned at a news conference that residents using private wells near the derailment site should use only bottled water. Reporters pressed DeWine and other officials on Tuesday about some residents' complaints of headaches and concerns over the situation. US Representative Jamaal Bowman, a Democrat from New York, said on social media on Monday: ""This is one of the deadliest environmental emergencies. And no one is talking about it."" Sil Caggiano, a hazardous materials specialist, warned: ""There's a lot of what-ifs, and we're going to be looking at this thing five, 10, 15, 20 years down the line and wondering. Cancer clusters could pop up, you know, well water could go bad."" Wang Wenbin, spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, said on Tuesday that some Western media chose to ignore the derailment at the time it happened, adding that this was not the first time they have done so, despite their boasts of being free, professional and fair. Railroad union officials said they have been warning that such an accident could happen because, they alleged, railroad cost-cutting has harmed safety measures. According to the US Department of Transportation, about 4.5 million metric tons of toxic chemicals are transported by rail each year, with an average of 12,000 rail cars shipping the materials through cities and towns each day. The incident is ""the tip of the iceberg"", Ron Kaminkow, general secretary of the cross-union group Railroad Workers United, was quoted by The Guardian as saying. ""If something is not done, then it's going to get worse, and the next derailment could be cataclysmic.""",Chinadaily.com.cn,2023-02-17 09:14

""I am here to show that NATO stands in solidarity with Trkiye,"" Stoltenberg said at a joint press conference with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu in the Turkish capital of Ankara. His visit came after massive earthquakes hit the country on Feb. 6, saying it was the biggest disaster in NATO territory since the political and military alliance was established The quakes have killed at least 36,187 people, and injured 108,068 others in the country, the Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency said in a statement on Thursday.

178,Earthquake survivor from China's Sichuan saving lives in quake-hit Türkiye,"  CHENGDU, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- When a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck Lushan County in Ya'an, southwest China's Sichuan Province, in April 2013, Zeng Qiangfei was a 15-year-old local student in the morning class. ""We rushed downstairs in a panic after feeling the strong tremors. I fell and almost got trampled on. Luckily, a classmate rapidly pulled me up,"" recalled Zeng. His family was later placed in a temporary settlement as their house, along with too many buildings, was reduced to rubble. Now, the young man is in Türkiye, racing against time to save lives after the twin earthquakes of 7.7 and 7.6 magnitudes devastated southern provinces of the country on Feb. 6. As a member of the Sichuan branch of Ramunion, a Chinese rescue team, Zeng didn't hesitate to join the international rescue force after receiving a call-up from the headquarters on Feb. 8. The exit and entry administration in Lushan expedited the issuance of Zeng's passport. Within two days, Zeng and his teammates embarked on the rescue journey with first aid kits, disinfectant, light-duty demolition tools, and other relief materials. Having survived a massive quake, Zeng said his gratitude for the people who had lent a helping hand to his hometown encouraged him to help others in danger, even if they were half a world away. ""I remember seeing rescuers work day and night searching for signs of life and treating the injured. Such scenes were so powerful that they greatly dispelled my fear,"" said Zeng. People in Sichuan are no strangers to earthquakes. Over the past two decades, several counties, including Wenchuan, Jiuzhaigou, and Lushan, have experienced earthquakes of above 7.0 magnitudes and suffered enormous life and property losses. In the aftermath of the devastating disasters, rescuers and volunteers from across the country and even abroad risked their own lives to help people in the quake-stricken areas. Zeng joined the Ramunion in 2021 when he had already taken a job in the catering industry. ""But whenever there is a disaster that needs rescue efforts from Ramunion, my teammates and I would ask for a leave from work immediately and head to the disaster scene,"" he said. In June 2022, Lushan County suffered another strong quake. Zeng was working in the provincial capital of Chengdu but rushed back home as a rescuer this time and pulled many people out of harm's way. Three months later, a 6.9-magnitude earthquake jolted Sichuan's Luding County. Zeng and his teammates worked for six days in a hard-hit village cut off from the outside world. They assisted firefighters in rescue and evacuation and undertook the job of delivering and distributing relief materials. With all the experiences in quake relief and rescue skills acquired through special training sessions, Zeng and his Ramunion teammates in Türkiye have searched over 170 collapsed buildings and got nine trapped survivors out. Joining international disaster relief for the first time, Zeng said he gained a better understanding of the notion of a community with a shared future for humanity. ""National boundaries don't matter when disasters happen because we all live in the same global village,"" added Zeng.",Xinhua,2023-02-17 10:52

However, compared with the four general strikes held since Jan. 19, Thursday's nationwide demonstration had the lowest participation rate, given the fact that a large part of France is on school holidays. Nevertheless, according to the CGT, France's largest union, some 1.3 million people took to the streets on Thursday. The CGT announced that 300,000 people marched in Paris, although the Paris Prefecture counted 37,000. Many public and private sectors in France also protested on Thursday, but the strike rate dropped considerably.

185,Experts deride U.S. as major contributor to financial plight in Arab countries,"BEIRUT, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States is a major contributor to the financial predicaments in some Arab countries, due to its aggressive financial and economic policies, several experts have said. Since 2022, the United States has raised interest rates on deposits to prevent capital flight, forcing other nations, namely vulnerable ones, to increase their interest rates as well to hold deposits in their banks. The U.S. move has also compelled those countries to pay higher interests on their international debts, resulting in tremendous pressure on their foreign reserves, Pierre Khoury, vice president of the Arab Chinese Cooperation and Development Association, told Xinhua. ""Most of the financially vulnerable Arab countries faced huge depletion in international reserves that led to repeated devaluation in their local currencies versus the U.S. dollar, causing mounting inflation that affected the budgets in developing nations,"" Khoury said. While accusing the United States of inflaming wars in the Middle East, Adnan Bourji, director of the Lebanese National Center for Studies, pointed out that the United States has damaged regular ties among neighboring Middle East countries through economic sanctions, giving the example of the Caesar Act imposed by the United States. The Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019 is a piece of U.S. legislation that sanctions the Syrian president and government over what Washington claimed to be ""war crimes against the Syrian people."" The act was signed into law by former U.S. President Donald Trump in late 2019 and came into effect in mid-2020. ""This is why Egypt refrained from providing Lebanon with gas for electricity for fear of unjust American sanctions,"" he said. The expert also mentioned that in early September 2021, governments of the four Arab countries agreed to export natural gas from Egypt to Lebanon via Jordanian and Syrian territories, in a bid to alleviate Lebanon's power shortage. However, the gas has yet to flow. In October 2022, Lebanese Energy Minister Walid Fayad told Egyptian media that the Caesar Act and related World Bank terms were stalling the deal. For Refaat Badawi, an adviser to former Lebanese Prime Minister Salim al Hoss, it is natural that the United States relies on economic sanctions such as the Caesar Act, since its attempt to submit Arab countries to its military power has failed, prompting America to weaken the Arab world economically and financially.",Xinhua,2023-02-17 13:25

While residents are able to return to their homes after the evacuation order was lifted last week, they have reported burning eyes, ill pets, or dead fish in waterways, thus demanding answers to how the incident was handled and its impact of exposure to those chemicals. ""Why are people getting sick if there's nothing in the air or the water,"" a woman asked. ""This could've happened to thousands of communities just like ours,"" said another resident. ""We're just trying to figure it out. We just want answers."" Thirty-eight rail cars derailed and an additional 12 cars were damaged by fire, according to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. Fear of a possible explosion prompted hundreds of residents to evacuate. A lingering odor of chlorine led crews to manage detonations to release the chemical, discharging toxic and potentially deadly plumes of smoke into the air. The White House said on Thursday that residents of East Palestine, Ohio, should be concerned in light of the derailment. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said: ""They have questions. That's all understandable."" ""We're going to get through this together. We're going to hold Norfolk Southern accountable,"" Jean-Pierre told reporters at the White House, referring to the U.S. freight railroad that owns the derailed train. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine tweeted Thursday that he had spoken with the White House to address the need for federal help in East Palestine. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency wrote in an update on Thursday that it had completed screening 486 homes and that test results from the municipal well sampling ""showed no water quality concerns."" Norfolk Southern is facing at least four class action lawsuits that allege negligence over the crash. ""I know there are still a lot of questions without answers,"" Norfolk Southern Corporation President and CEO Alan Shaw wrote in a letter to the community of East Palestine on Thursday.

228,Chinese satellites deployed for Turkish earthquake relief,"BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- China has deployed several satellites to capture images of the quake-hit areas in Türkiye, helping the country to analyze the disaster situation and allocate relief resources more effectively, according to the industry newspaper China Space News. Using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images provided by China's L-SAR 01, researchers accurately portrayed the extent of the damage caused by the earthquakes and provided important data support for post-earthquake rescue efforts in Türkiye, said the newspaper. China's L-SAR 01 is a satellite group composed of two satellites equipped with L-band SAR, namely the L-SAR 01A and the L-SAR 01B. Both satellites were launched last year, and were tasked with providing data to support land resource management, mapping, forestry, and disaster prevention and relief. ""SAR"" refers to a microwave-imaging radar system that emits electromagnetic waves to Earth and receives echoes. It can take high-definition microwave pictures of the land surface. Following the twin earthquakes that rocked Türkiye and Syria on Feb. 6, Chinese researchers acquired post-earthquake SAR images from L-SAR 01 on Feb. 10. After differential interference processing with the pre-earthquake SAR images, they obtained the isoseismic deformation field of the two strong earthquakes, the newspaper noted. Moreover, after the massive earthquakes, satellite images taken by China's Gaojing-1 04 satellite on Feb. 8 showed that a fire broke out in Iskenderun port in southern Türkiye and that some of the port's containers collapsed, according to the newspaper. ""The satellite images helped people analyze the situation in quake-affected areas and carry out rescue work,"" it said. The newspaper also pointed out in its microblog that more than 10 civil and commercial satellites, including Gaofen-1 02/03, Gaofen-2, and Gaofen-3 01/03 were deployed to capture images of the quake-hit areas in Türkiye. By Feb. 10, a total of 67 remote sensing images were obtained, including 34 optical images and 33 SAR images, it added. According to the newspaper, analysis results of the satellite image data were sent to the Chinese international rescue team in Türkiye, and were also provided to the Turkish government through the International Charter Space and Major Disasters. In addition, some academic institutions in China are also analyzing data from Chinese satellites to assist the relief efforts. A research team from Wuhan University used China's high-resolution satellites to carry out the high-precision monitoring of lights in affected areas at night, providing data to the United Nations Satellite Centre to aid relief work. The earth science satellite SDGSAT-1, developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, provided pre-disaster data for researchers to compare with post-disaster conditions. The commercial space telescope Yangwang-1, developed by Origin Space Technology Co., Ltd., and the micro-nano satellite QMX-1, developed by Wuhan University, have also been deployed.",Xinhua,2023-02-17 16:26
229,U.S. is world's biggest spy power,"  BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- An utterly harmless, unmanned civilian airship has been in the cross-hairs in the latest anti-China stunt pulled by some U.S. politicians and media. However, the ploy of accusing China of flying surveillance balloon has only made their smear attack look quite clumsy and ludicrous as it's no secret the United States itself is the world's biggest spy power with the world's widest intelligence network. Living up to the epithet of ""surveillance empire,"" the United State has, for decades, conducted indiscriminate mass surveillance of foreign governments, companies and individuals as well as its own citizens.  When it comes to surveillance, it's necessary to point out the United States is the world's No. 1 surveillance state, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin has said in a recent press briefing. According to Politico, the Pentagon has spent billions of dollars developing high-altitude reconnaissance balloons since 1997 and quietly transitioned the balloon projects to the military services in 2022. The balloons may be used to track hypersonic strategic cruise missiles being developed by China and Russia.   Permeating through every part of the world, the U.S. surveillance network also targets the country's allies. In May 2021, Denmark's national broadcaster DR News reported that the Danish Defense Intelligence Service had given the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) open Internet access to spy on senior politicians of countries, including then German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The NSA purposefully obtained data and thus was able to spy on targeted heads of state, as well as Scandinavian leaders, top politicians, and high-ranking officials in Germany, Sweden, Norway and France, the report said, which caused global shock and fury. French President Emmanuel Macron said in May 2021 that this ""is unacceptable between allies, even less between allies and European partners,"" and Merkel said she ""could only agree"" with Macron's comments. But that was not unfamiliar to European leaders. In 2013, former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed that Washington had been spying on the email and cell phone communications of as many as 35 world leaders. Journalist Glenn Greenwald exposed in his book No Place to Hide that a single unit of the NSA had collected more than 97 billion emails and 124 billion phone calls from around the world in just 30 days in 2013. The powerful mass surveillance system has helped the United States make profits. For example, in 2013, reports of the U.S. magazine WIRED surfaced that Brazil's state oil and gas giant Petrobras was a prime target of U.S. government spying activity. ""Washington is losing its moral ground,"" the German magazine Focus quoted an expert on foreign policy as saying. With its global surveillance network, ""the United States itself is the true eavesdropper,"" Focus said, though the country prefers to frame itself as a victim of spying.  According to a recent report by Georgetown University Law Center's Center on Privacy and Technology, the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has expanded far beyond its role as an immigration agency to become a ""domestic surveillance agency."" The ICE has developed a dragnet surveillance system that allows it to collect detailed dossiers on nearly every person in America at any time, without any judicial, legislative, or public oversight, said the report titled ""American Dragnet: Data-driven Deportation in the 21st Century.""   From 2008 to 2021, the ICE has spent approximately 2.8 billion U.S. dollars on surveillance, data collection and data-sharing initiatives, the report said, noting the agency has been able to access utility record information of over 218 million customers across all 50 states. The ICE is not the only agency in the United States that has overreached its authority and abused citizens' private personal data. In fact, mass surveillance in the United States has become institutionalized. Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the United States enacted numerous laws to expand the government's surveillance powers for national security reasons. The U.S. Congress greenlighted the Patriot Act in 2001, which covers Section 215, one of the most controversial programs for domestic and international surveillance. In 2008, Congress approved Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows the government to collect communications concerning foreign intelligence targets without a warrant. Following the disclosure by Snowden and Wikileaks of the U.S. government's abuse of power to collect millions of Americans' private data, the ensuing public outcry prompted Congress to prohibit the notorious bugging project PRISM. However, the government actually never stops abusing its power to carry out indiscriminate surveillance on its citizens. In 2021 alone, the FBI has conducted up to 3.4 million warrantless searches of Americans' phone calls, emails and text messages, the Hill reported, citing the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.",Xinhua,2023-02-17 16:29
230,Chinese university students design power box to help rescue efforts in quake-hit Türkiye ,"After learning that the quake-struck regions in Türkiye are in urgent need of portable power sources, seven junior students from Tongji University in east China’s Shanghai used their knowledge to design an emergency photovoltaic energy storage power box, which will be transported to Türkiye by a charter flight along with other relief supplies.   “We designed the power box mainly to charge communications devices such as mobile phones and provide lighting with its LED lights in the evening,”says Bai Haoran, a member of the design team.   With a capacity of 500WH (watt hours), the power box consists of photovoltaic panels, lithium batteries and LED lights. It is equipped with USB ports, DC charging ports, and sockets for household appliances. The power box is very light and can be recharged in multiple ways, including by photovoltaic panels, car batteries, and municipal power supply. They can also meet the requirements for flexibility and portability during rescue operations.   A Turkish-speaking foreign student also helped them translate manuals into Turkish so that local rescuers would understand how to use the power box.   ",People's Daily Online,2023-02-17 16:34
231,Rescuers from E China's Zhejiang return home after completing rescue missions in Türkiye,"Chinese rescue teams from east China's Zhejiang Province are on their way back or have returned home after wrapping up their rescue operations in quake-hit areas in Türkiye.     On Feb. 16, the Rescue Team of Ramunion, the first civil rescue team in China to participate in rescue work in Türkiye, came back to Hangzhou, capital city of Zhejiang, after completing its rescue operations. Upon their arrival in Türkiye, the eight rescue experts met with the local support team and together headed for Iskenderun, Hatay Province to carry out rescue work. ""After we arrived in Iskenderun, we inspected the damage caused to the buildings, reinforced buildings that had survived the earthquake and searched for and rescued people,"" said Wang Bin, head of the Rescue Team of Ramunion.   ""Because we had professional rescue equipment and techniques, we quickly earned the trust of the local people, who would come to us for help,"" Wang said. On Feb. 9, the rescue team successfully saved seven survivors from the ruins, including a family. On Feb. 10, they saved another two survivors in Antakya, Hatay Province.   On Feb. 13, the rescue team left Hatay Province. Over the course of five days, the Chinese rescuers searched for survivors in the rubble of 178 buildings, saved nine survivors and found 15 victims. ""The local citizens really appreciated our work. When we were on the return journey, the local citizens, after seeing the uniforms we were wearing and the the Chinese national flag on our uniforms, hugged us, shook hands with us and some even said ‘thank you’ to us in Chinese to express their gratitude for coming from far away to help them,"" Wang recalled. ""This is our first overseas rescue mission after COVID hit. It is not simply about saving lives, but reflects the sincere feelings of the people of the two countries toward each other in the face of the disaster,"" said He Jun, founder of the Rescue Team of Ramunion, who said that the team will make greater contributions to future overseas rescue missions based on the experience accumulated during its rescue operations in Türkiye. The Guixing Rescue Team from Zhuji city, a county-level city in Shaoxing city, is scheduled to arrive in Hangzhou on Feb. 17. At 9 p.m. on Feb. 13 local time, the Guixing Rescue Team, together with other rescue teams, successfully saved a 10-year-old girl from ruins in Kahramanmaras Province, Türkiye. The girl had been buried in the ruins for nearly 178 hours. When the girl was pulled out, everyone at the site applauded the miracle. The girl was immediately transferred to hospital and is currently in stable condition. Over the course of four days, the Guixing Rescue Team saved one survivor and found 30 victims. ""Thank you very much. The Chinese rescuers are very professional,"" said a Turkish translator, who was assigned to help the Chinese rescuers carry out their rescue work, conveying the local residents' gratitude toward them.         After carrying out about 111 hours of intensive rescue operations, four rescuers from the Yinzhou Blue Sky Rescue Team in Ningbo city began their return journey on Feb. 14. The 10-member Zhejiang branch of the Blue Sky Rescue Team, which the four rescuers from Ningbo are part of, saved two survivors from ruins in quake-hit areas in Türkiye, including an 83-year-old who had been buried under rubble for 117 hours before being saved. They also found 25 victims.  ",People's Daily Online,2023-02-17 17:58
233,Racial disparities in U.S. diabetics correlate to higher risk hyperglycaemia: study,"LOS ANGELES, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- A new study has found that Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic Black diabetes patients have the most cases of severe hyperglycaemia in the United States. The study, recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, used data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey among 2,482 adults to conduct a serial, population-based, cross-sectional analysis. The study revealed that among adults currently diagnosed with diabetes and receiving insulin, individuals who self-identified as Mexican Americans or non-Hispanic Black had the highest prevalence of severe hyperglycaemia. Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic Black individuals who had been prescribed insulin had 2.29 and 2.48 times the odds of having severe hyperglycaemia, respectively, when compared with non-Hispanic Whites, according to the study. This trend suggests that racial disparities may play a role in current diabetes outcomes, and the disparities might even be increasing, according to the study.",Xinhua,2023-02-18 10:32

157,U.S. food sanitation company employed over 100 children in hazardous jobs: gov't investigation,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) revealed on Friday that one of the country's largest food sanitation companies employed more than 100 children for dangerous jobs. Packers Sanitation Services Inc. (PSSI), based in Kieler, Wisconsin, has paid 1.5 million U.S. dollars in civil money penalties after a DOL investigation found that the company ""employed at least 102 children -- from 13 to 17 years of age -- in hazardous occupations and had them working overnight shifts at 13 meat processing facilities in eight states,"" a statement read. Children were working with hazardous chemicals and cleaning meat processing equipment including back saws, brisket saws, and head splitters, according to the investigation, which began in August 2022. ""The child labor violations in this case were systemic and reached across eight states, and clearly indicate a corporate-wide failure by Packers Sanitation Services at all levels,"" Jessica Looma, principal deputy administrator of the DOL's Wage and Hour Division said. ""These children should never have been employed in meat packing plants and this can only happen when employers do not take responsibility to prevent child labor violations from occurring in the first place."" ""Our investigation found Packers Sanitation Services' systems flagged some young workers as minors, but the company ignored the flags,"" Wage and Hour Regional Administrator Michael Lazzeri in Chicago said. ""When the Wage and Hour Division arrived with warrants, the adults -- who had recruited, hired and supervised these children -- tried to derail our efforts to investigate their employment practices,"" Lazzeri added. Forms of child labor, including indentured servitude and child slavery, have existed throughout American history, and the number of child laborers across the country peaked in the early decades of the 20th century, according to The University of Iowa Labor Center. Though the Fair Labor Standards Act was passed in 1938, it didn't ban child labor in the United States. Under U.S. labor law, children as young as 12 can work unlimited hours on farms of any size with parental permission, as long as they do not miss school. There is no minimum age for children to work on small farms or family farms. The United States is the only country in the world that has not ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, a comprehensive human rights treaty on children's rights and notably the most widely ratified treaty since its introduction in 1989.",Xinhua,2023-02-18 10:35
158,5 pct of U.S. homicides committed by police: The Guardian,"LONDON, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- In the United States, an estimated one in 20 gun homicides are committed by police, as law enforcement killings have failed to decrease despite years of nationwide protests, The Guardian said in a report. Law enforcement officers killed at least 1,192 people in 2022, the highest number recorded in a decade, the report said on Wednesday, quoting Mapping Police Violence, a prominent non-profit database of police killings. More than 1,100 people were killed by the police in both 2020 and 2021, it added. Since only a small number of deadly incidents each year receive wide media attention, many Americans may not realize that ""a meaningful fraction of homicides in the United States are police killings,"" it quoted Justin Feldman, a researcher at the Center for Policing Equity, as saying. The United States has much higher rates of both police killings and overall homicides than other wealthy countries, it noted.",Xinhua,2023-02-18 10:48
159,Over 33 million children vaccinated against wild poliovirus in southern Africa: WHO,"BRAZZAVILLE, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- A year since Malawi confirmed its first case of wild poliovirus type 1 in 30 years, more than 33 million children across five southern African countries have been vaccinated against the virus, with over 80 million vaccine doses administered over the past year, said the World Health Organization (WHO) in a statement released on Friday. A total of nine wild poliovirus cases have been reported so far, with one in Malawi and eight in neighboring Mozambique since the declaration of an outbreak on Feb. 17, 2022, in Malawi. The last confirmed case to date was in August 2022 in Mozambique. The wild poliovirus in Malawi and Mozambique originated from Pakistan, one of the two last endemic countries, according to the WHO regional office for Africa, based in Brazzaville, the capital of the Republic of the Congo. Concerted emergency response launched following the outbreak in 2022 has helped increase protection among children through vaccines in Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. The countries have also ramped up disease surveillance and community mobilization to help find cases and halt the virus. To date, 19 vaccination rounds have been concluded in the most at-risk areas, and at least five more are planned for 2023 in the five countries. ""Southern Africa countries have made huge efforts to bolster polio detection, curb the spread of the virus and ensure that children live without the risk of infection and lifelong paralysis,"" said Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa. ""We continue to support the polio control efforts across the region so that every child receives the protection they need."" Additionally, more than 10 new environmental surveillance sites have been set up over the past year in the affected countries with support from WHO. The fully operational sites are playing a critical role in the efforts to detect silent circulating poliovirus in wastewater. ""Response teams have worked intensely in the fight against polio not only in Malawi but in the rest of the neighboring countries in a coordinated manner. We will not rest until we reach and vaccinate every child to stop polio transmission,"" said Emeka Agbo, Acting Country Coordinator for the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in Malawi. Reaching all households where eligible children live is critical to protect them against the risk of paralysis. The national health authorities, with support from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, are paying efforts to map cross-border communities, migratory routes, border crossings and transit routes. Polio is highly infectious and affects unimmunized or under-immunized children. In Malawi and Mozambique, the disease has paralyzed children younger than 15 years. There is no cure for polio, and it can only be prevented by immunization. Children across the world remain at risk of wild polio type 1 as long as the virus is not eradicated in the last remaining areas in which it is still circulating. On Jan. 25, 2023, the WHO Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations concluded that the risk of the international spread of poliovirus remains a public health emergency of international concern.",Xinhua,2023-02-18 10:49

President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo of Ghana noted the ""absence of solidarity"" in the current global order at a side event of the conference, saying that African people have been left alone to fend for themselves in recent global crises, such as their limited access to vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, addressing the MSC opening ceremony, also called for ""new forms of international solidarity and participation"" in the ""multipolar world of the 21st century."" Acknowledging that reshaping the global order is a ""huge emergency,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said that efforts should be made to make it ""more inclusive."" ""I'm very impressed by how much we are losing the trust of the Global South,"" Macron said, adding that the developed countries failed the Global South during the COVID-19 pandemic by committing more than what they delivered. The Global South's disillusionment with the existing world order and their calls for reshaping it also came under the spotlight in a report published by the MSC on Monday. The report, titled ""Re:vision,"" said that many countries of the Global South have so far been confined to the role of ""rule-takers"" under the existing global order and their ""legitimate resentment"" should be paid due respect. The report called for re-envisioning a world order that ""better delivers on its promises"" and ""truly benefits everyone equally.""

Not only will the 31.4 trillion U.S. dollars debt go up dramatically -- by nearly 19 trillion dollars over the next decade -- if things continue on their current course, but if Congress doesn't increase the debt ceiling, the government will be unable to pay its bills sometime between July and September this year, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) said in a report. The debt ceiling is the amount the U.S. government is allowed to borrow and is used to pay bills already incurred. The Treasury Department has already instituted ""extraordinary measures"" to ensure bills are being paid now, but in the next few months, those measures won't be enough anymore, the CBO said. ""As a result, the government would have to delay making payments for some activities, default on its debt obligations, or both,"" the CBO said. The country has been living on credit for centuries, but the debt is becoming an increasing burden, especially because of the rise in interest rates, said U.S. News and World Report.

The White House spent ""the month of February scrambling jets to fire 400,000-dollar missiles at the local hobby club's 12-dollar balloons,"" he tweeted Friday, following reports that the UFOs are likely to be just civilian balloons from local hobbyists. The shooting down of the UFOs was just a political stunt to divert the public's attention from the investigation into the sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines, said Snowden Tuesday, who had exposed the NSA's extensive surveillance program over U.S. citizens and foreign leaders in 2013. The North American Aerospace Defense Command said last week that it had discovered three UFOs, two of which were shot down by the U.S. military in U.S. airspace, while the third was discovered over Canadian soil. ""It's just the old engineered panic"" to ensure that national security reporters get assigned to investigate balloon nonsense ""rather than (U.S.) budgets or bombings (of Nord Stream),"" said Snowden. Earlier this month, American investigative journalist Seymour Hersh disclosed that the U.S. Navy divers, operating under the cover of a widely publicized mid-summer NATO exercise known as BALTOPS 22, planted the remotely triggered explosives last June in cooperation with Norway, which destroyed three of the four Nord Stream pipelines three months later. The White House has since denied the claims.",Xinhua,2023-02-18 11:16
170,Biden says American communities being torn apart by gun violence,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement on Friday that American communities are ""being torn apart by gun violence."" The statement was issued hours after six people were shot and killed in a rural Mississippi town. ""Thoughts and prayers aren't enough,"" Biden said. ""Gun violence is an epidemic and Congress must act now."" He asked for what he called commonsense gun law reforms, including, among other things, requiring background checks on all gun sales and banning assault weapons. However, it is unlikely that the U.S. Congress would pass those proposals with Republicans controlling the House of Representatives this term and advocating for the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. A shooter -- identified as Richard Dale Crum -- was taken into custody on Friday afternoon after reportedly opening fire on his ex-wife and potentially other family members at three different locations in Arkabutla, a small town in Mississippi's Tate County. Crum, 52, faces charges of first-degree murder in connection with the rampage, according to the Tate County Sheriff's Office. Additional charges, for each of the other victims, will be filed in the coming days. Crum is being held without bond in the Tate County Jail. ""Our hearts are heavy as we learned about the tragic event that happened in Arkabutla,"" the Tate County Government wrote in a Facebook post on Friday night. Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves said on Friday afternoon that he has been briefed on the series of shootings in Tate County. ""We believe he acted alone. His motive is not yet known,"" Reeves said in a statement, adding that the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation has been asked to assist in the investigation. The United States has lost more than 5,500 lives to gun violence so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive.",Xinhua,2023-02-18 16:22

The three-day 59th MSC concluded Sunday in Munich, south Germany. About 150 senior officials, including over 40 heads of state and government, and leaders of international organizations gathered here to discuss pressing global security challenges and concerns. In a panel discussion titled ""Recalibrating the Compass: South-North Cooperation,"" Ghanaian President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo said the consequences of recent crises such as the COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine conflict have shown a lack of solidarity.   In response to European Council President Charles Michel who addressed the global challenges by requiring greater solidarity, more international cooperation, mutual understanding and dialogue, Akufo-Addo said, ""We are the continent of being left alone, (should) defend for ourselves."" Citing some Western countries' reluctance to help while Africa was desperate to get access to COVID-19 vaccines, Akufo-Addo said: ""That is one example of the absence of solidarity ... We need real South-North cooperation."" Addressing another panel discussion, Namibian Prime Minister Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila said that it has been difficult or impossible for countries of the Global South to benefit from their own resources in history, and now they need sustainable and mutually beneficial cooperation.   She hoped that Namibia's cooperation projects with Europe, including Germany, can provide energy not only for Europe but also for Namibia, as her country needs to solve its own problems of high energy costs and energy security, create more jobs and boost the economy. Referring to supporters of the Global South countries, Togolese Foreign Minister Robert Dussey told Xinhua that China is one of the leading supporters for African economic development and transportation improvement. Africa should have their own position and vision, Dussey said. ""We can work with China, with Western people, with everyone."" For now, the focus is on the development of the African continent. ""Our challenge is to change the life of our population like the example in China,"" he said.   The Global South's disillusionment with the existing world order and their calls for reshaping it also came under the spotlight in a report published by the MSC on Monday. The report, titled ""Re:vision,"" said that many countries of the Global South have so far been confined to the role of ""rule-takers"" under the existing global order and their ""legitimate resentment"" should be paid due respect. As to the one-sided understanding of the rules by the West, Zhou Bo, senior fellow of the Center for International Security and Strategy in Tsinghua University, said it was set for the West themselves economically after the Second World War as a world order, which actually shows a kind of Western arrogance, prejudice and narcissism. With human and technological development, globalization is bound to accelerate and the need for cooperation will intensify, Zhou told Xinhua.",Xinhua,2023-02-20 08:17

232,Search and rescue work to end as quake-hit Türkiye moves to shelter homeless,"ANKARA, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkish authorities have almost completed search and rescue work nearly two weeks after massive earthquakes that claimed more than 40,000 lives in the country, a Turkish disaster agency said Sunday. Search and rescue are still underway in 40 buildings of two heavily-damaged southern provinces, Hatay and Kahramanmaras, head of Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) Yunus Sezer, said at a press conference. Works in the other quake-hit regions now focused on debris removal, sheltering the homeless, and infrastructure preparations, the AFAD chief said. The death toll from two major earthquakes that struck southern Türkiye on Feb. 6 has risen to 40,689, Sezer noted. The figure is likely to increase further as search teams pull out more bodies. Rescue teams have not found any survivors in the past 24 hours. The quake zone is estimated to have a population of 13.5 million, and many of them are now homeless, as their houses have either collapsed or are too dangerous to get in. The Turkish government, along with local and international aid organizations, has launched a massive relief effort. The authorities are working to provide more temporary accommodation with tents and containers, while many survivors are still taking shelter in hotels, dormitories, gyms, and train cars under low temperatures, if not evacuated to the other parts of the country. More than 6,000 containers have been installed so far, the infrastructure works for the establishment of 68,000 containers are about to be completed and the aim is to set up 100,000 containers within two months, Sezer said, adding that nearly 250,000 tents were already in use. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday that 2.2 million people had left the disaster zone. However, many survivors prefer to stay close to their houses to protect their possessions, while some others are waiting for debris removal to recover the bodies of their relatives. The AFAD issued a circular on Sunday saying entrance is not allowed for the destroyed buildings, and possessions collection will be carried out under the supervision of security forces. Local authorities have started disinfecting debris areas and trash cans to prevent outbreaks of infectious diseases. No outbreaks of infectious diseases have been detected to date in the quake zone, said Turkish Health Minister, while the ministry warned people against drinking tap water. A magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck Türkiye's southern province of Kahramanmaras at 4:17 a.m. local time (0117 GMT), followed by a magnitude 6.4 quake a few minutes later in the country's southern province of Gaziantep and a magnitude 7.6 earthquake at 1:24 p.m. local time (1024 GMT) in the Kahramanmaras Province. The quake-hit region in southern Türkiye is home to millions of Syrian refugees that fled their country after a civil war erupted in 2011. Türkiye hosts nearly 3.5 million Syrian refugees, roughly half of them have been taking shelter in the region hit by devastating quakes. Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said on Sunday that at least 10,633 Syrian refugees in the country have returned to their homeland voluntarily after the quakes.

143,"Hacker group with members from Europe, North America found to have launched cyberattacks against China","Chinese cybersecurity experts have exposed a hacker group, with its core members coming from Europe and North America, which has been launching sustained cyberattacks against China as its primary target, posing a serious threat to the country’s cybersecurity and data security, the Global Times learned from a Beijing-based cybersecurity lab on Sunday. In a report the Global Times obtained from Qi An Pangu lab, it revealed the hacking group, named Against The West (ATW), has claimed to have disclosed sensitive information including source code and database of important information systems related to China about more than 70 times since 2021, involving some 300 information systems of more than 100 important government agencies as well as aviation and infrastructure departments. In particular, since 2022, ATW has intensified its momentum and continued to carry out large-scale scanning detection and “supply chain” attacks on Chinese networks, the report shows. Through long-term tracking, cybersecurity experts from Qi An Pangu lab found that the active members of ATW are mainly engaged in programming and network engineer-related occupations and they are mainly located in Switzerland, France, Poland, Canada and other countries. This is the second time that the lab revealed the true face of a hacker organization that has been carrying out data theft and network attacks on China, following the exposure of the complete technical detailsof Equation, an elite hacking group affiliated with the NSA, in February 2022. Equation was found to have been creating an advanced and covert backdoor, which has been used to monitor 45 countries and regions for over a decade. According to the report, the ATW group was established in June 2021 and became active in online forums in October that year. Since its establishment, ATW has expressed a clear anti-China bias. It publicly stated that it would “publish posts about data leakage in China, North Korea and other countries.” It also published a special post entitled “ATW-War against China,” which explicitly supported “Taiwan independence,” advocated “Hong Kong independence” and hyped up “human rights issues” in China’s Xinjiang region. Since October 2021, the organization has been active across overseas social media platforms, displaying a clear pro-US and pro-West slant. ATW has published several statements claiming that the organization’s targets are Russia, Belarus, China, Iran and North Korea and it is willing to share files with the US and the EU or hired by their related agencies. According to incomplete statistics, since 2021, ATW has disclosed important information system source code, database and other sensitive information more than 70 times. The organization claimed that the data came from more than 100 Chinese departments, involving government agencies and state-owned enterprises. For example, on January 7, 2022, ATW claimed to sell “a large amount of government, NGO, institutional and corporate data in China, involving 102 Chinese entities.” However, experts from the lab found that the so-called source code is the test data or project code files developed by small and medium-sized software development enterprises. Experts also found that, in order to gain attention, ATW tends to distort and exaggerate its attacks. The lab team identified six active members from the ATW, with three of them from France and one from Canada. One of the members Tillie Kottmann, born in Switzerland, was charged by the US Department of Justice in March 2021, but the case was abruptly suspended at the end of March. Since then, China has been one of Kottmann’s main targets, according to the lab report. The organization mainly carried out large-scale scanning and attacks against technical vulnerabilities on SonarQube, Gogs, Gitblit and other open-source network systems. They would then steal related source code and data, which can be used to further exploit and penetrate the network information system. ""This is a typical ‘supply chain' attack,"" a senior cybersecurity expert from the lab told the Global Times on Sunday. He suggested that software development enterprises should immediately repair software vulnerabilities, strictly control public network access permissions, and make timely modifications to default access passwords, and further improve the security management ability of source code. As for the leakage of the system source code deployed in the user unit, the expert suggested that software development enterprises should strengthen the security audit of the system source code and encrypt and store the source code and data of important information systems. ""Cybersecurity-related government departments and technical teams should strengthen the monitoring of illegal cyberattack activities of the ATW organization, warn the trend of attack, and carry out background tracing and other countermeasures,"" the expert said.",By Cao Siqi (Global Times) ,2023-02-20 09:06

141,China's aid to quake-hit areas mirrors major country responsibility,"Devastating earthquakes recently took place in southern Türkiye and northern Syria, causing heavy casualties in both countries. Chinese President Xi Jinping sent messages of condolence to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad respectively over strong earthquakes in the two countries on the day the quakes struck. On behalf of the Chinese government and people, Xi expressed deep condolences to the victims and offered sincere sympathies to the bereaved families and the injured.   China, following the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind, has been contributing to the earthquake relief in the two countries through multiple ways, demonstrating its sense of responsibility as a major country. The country expressed willingness to provide emergency humanitarian assistance to Türkiye and Syria at the earliest time possible, and soon launched an assistance mechanism. It has offered emergency humanitarian aid for both countries and dispatched rescue teams to quake-hit areas. So far, Chinese rescuers have pulled out more than 20 survivors and China's relief supplies have rapidly arrived in the two countries. A friend in need is a friend indeed. China unswervingly follows the international humanitarian spirit and has taken swift actions. The governments and people of Türkiye and Syria extended their gratitude to the Chinese side for the emergency humanitarian assistance, saying that China, taking the lead to offer timely support, has played an important role in earthquake relief and that they will remember the profound friendship from the Chinese people. The destiny and future of each and every nation and country are interlocked. The world is in the same boat, and countries should stick together and share weal and woe. On the packages of aid donated by the Chinese government to Syria, it is written in both Chinese and Arabic that ""Rose fragrance flows thousands of miles, while sincerity and love are passed on in distress,"" which carries the deep concern of the Chinese government and people for Syrians in the disaster-hit areas. In less than two days since the earthquakes took place, Chinese people from all walks of life had made thousands of donations to the Embassy of Syria in China. Besides, Chinese-funded organizations and overseas Chinese in Syria have also launched quake-relief activities. These actions demonstrated the beliefs advocated by Chinese culture that all peoples are one family and the world is a commonwealth.   In Türkiye, residents in quake-hit areas sent food to Chinese rescuers with slips of paper that wrote ""thank you"" in Chinese. A local woman put the cold hands of a Chinese female rescuer under her coat to keep them warm. Such stories mirrored the strength of human solidarity in the storm. People in Türkiye and Syria spoke highly of China's selfless assistance during a hard time and expressed their appreciation for China, saying that China always stands with its friends that need help. This year marks the 10th anniversary since Xi proposed the idea of building a community with a shared future for mankind to the world. Over the past 10 years, China has always been striving for this vision with concrete actions, especially when facing natural disasters. When Nepal was hit by an 8.1-magnitude earthquake in 2015, the relief squad sent by China was the first international heavy urban search and rescue team to arrive in the Himalayan country, playing a positive role in the search and rescue missions there. A year later, China provided emergency humanitarian aid to Ecuador at the earliest time possible after a 7.8-magnitude earthquake took place in the South American country, sending quake-relief materials to Ecuador by five charter flights. As Cyclone Idai swept southeast Africa in 2019, China offered emergency humanitarian assistance for Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Malawi, and dispatched international rescue teams to Mozambique. Last year, a deadly earthquake hit Afghanistan. China, in around two weeks, sent batches of relief materials to Afghanistan with its Y-20 cargo aircraft and charter flights, among the first countries that provided the biggest and most tangible aid to Afghanistan. China's emergency assistance reflects the country's care for the world and its vision of building a community with a shared future with the rest of the world to overcome difficulties. The history of humanity is a history of achieving growth by meeting various tests and of developing by overcoming various crises. As long as the world works as one with solidarity and cooperation, mankind will surely be able to overcome difficulties and challenges head-on. China will keep following the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind and work with the international community to help and support people in Türkiye and Syria to dispel the shadow of the earthquakes and rebuild their homes at an early date.",People's Daily,2023-02-20 09:38
144,"Interview: U.S. high individual armament rate significant threat, says Turkish expert","   ISTANBUL, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States, with the highest civilian-owned firearms rate in the world, has been posing a significant threat at both the national and international levels, a Turkish security expert has said. ""The issue of personal armament in the United States is acute,"" as over 393 million guns, including rifles and pistols, are in civilian hands, Cihat Yayci, a retired Turkish admiral, told Xinhua in an interview. According to the Gun Violence Archive, a website that tracks shootings in the country, in the first month of this year alone, the United States has reported more than 3,700 deaths from gun violence, with 52 mass shootings. ""This disease can spread anywhere. We must be cautious,"" Yayci warned of the enormity of the threat. At this point, Yayci underlined the activities of the American gun lobbies in the United States and other countries, specifically highlighting the role of the National Rifle Association (NRA), an influential gun rights advocacy group in America. ""The NRA funds both Republicans and Democrats. And the association has been conducting intense propaganda among ordinary people,"" he said.   The NRA poured nearly 5 million U.S. dollars into lobbying in 2021. In other words, they spend millions of dollars on ""promoting themselves, endearing themselves, and gaining sympathy,"" Yayci said. The expert noted that the NRA should not be seen only as a ""national"" organization, as its activities have gone beyond the nation's borders, threatening global peace and security. Yayci also blamed the growing racist sentiments in the country against black people and Hispanics behind the increasing gun attacks, noting that the hate feeling became so widespread that it provoked a series of attacks. ""Racism is still prevalent in the United States and is an active fact. So we have to accept this very clearly once and for all. Racism has not been erased from American society, neither conceptually nor emotionally."" In Yayci's view, the country would not get rid of the growing gun violence soon and smoothly. ""As a soldier, we have an expression,"" he said. ""They make people live in a tension-controlled environment where no one feels safe,"" so politicians and gun lobbies could add to their earnings.",Xinhua,2023-02-20 09:41

In an interview with semi-official Mehr news agency published on Saturday, Nasser Kanaani said that despite the agreement between the two sides on the prisoner swap, the U.S. government has not fulfilled its pledge, and conditioned the issue on other matters, including the talks on the revival of a 2015 nuclear deal, which has led to a halt in the prisoner swap process. Kanaani stressed that Iran's approach on the prisoner swap is a humanitarian one, adding that Iran is ready to implement the agreement to help the Iranian nationals incarcerated in the United States to return to their families as soon as possible. Kanaani said the United States has detained a number of Iranian nationals on the alleged charges of having ""violated Washington's sanctions"" on Tehran, which Iran considers baseless as it sees the U.S. unilateral sanctions ""illegal and cruel."" Iran signed the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), with world powers in July 2015, agreeing to put some curbs on its nuclear program in return for the removal of the sanctions on the country. The United States, however, pulled out of the deal in May 2018 and reimposed its unilateral sanctions on Tehran, prompting the latter to reduce some of its nuclear commitments under the deal. The talks on the JCPOA's revival began in April 2021 in Vienna. No breakthrough has been achieved after the latest round of talks in August 2022.",Xinhua,2023-02-20 10:05
146,Turkish residents call for extensive probe into collapsed buildings in quakes,"ANKARA, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- Amid growing public anger, the Turkish government extends the judicial investigations over contractors of the buildings destroyed in the major earthquakes on Feb. 6. At least 120 people suspected of being responsible for collapsed buildings were arrested, and the prosecutors are continuing to gather evidence from the samples of the construction materials in the wreckage. Currently, there is a remarkable increase in damage assessment requests from property owners. The Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality has received 40,379 requests in the past six days for inspection of their buildings, said Bugra Gokce, deputy secretary-general of the municipality, in a statement on Friday. A total of 684,000 buildings were examined in the quake-affected provinces and 84,726 of them were found to be collapsed, heavily damaged or in immediate need of demolition, Turkish Environment, Urban Planning and Climate Change Minister Murat Kurum told reporters on Friday. The age of the buildings, the low bearing capacity of the floors on which the foundations are placed, and the poor quality of the construction materials were among the parameters effective in the destruction of those buildings, according to a report released on Friday by the academicians of Istanbul Technical University. In the aftermath of the 1999 earthquake in the northwestern province of Izmit that killed over 17,000 people, the Turkish government pledged to introduce new construction standards, with plans to strengthen the existing buildings. However, the latest disaster exposed once again the problems of construction safety breaches and lack of inspection, according to another report by the Chamber of Civil Engineers. In addition to the unqualified materials used in the construction, the report released last week drew attention to poor ground conditions, noting the severely-damaged areas are mostly the places where the settlements rise on fertile agricultural lands. The buildings of 10 to 15 storeys with a flexible load-bearing structure in these soft soil areas were severely damaged or completely collapsed during the earthquake, the report said. The death toll from the two major earthquakes that struck southeastern Türkiye has risen to 40,642 by Saturday. A magnitude 7.7-earthquake struck Türkiye's southern province of Kahramanmaras at 4:17 a.m. local time (0117 GMT), followed by a magnitude-7.6 one at 1:24 p.m. local time (1024 GMT) in Kahramanmaras.",Xinhua,2023-02-20 10:10

Kanaani also pointed to what he called the U.S. continued double-standard behavior in the fight against terrorism, saying it is evident in Washington's current policies and approaches. On Feb. 12, the IS killed 11 of the 75 people it kidnapped in eastern Syria.

155,Moscow to respond to Dutch decision to reduce Russian diplomat numbers,"MOSCOW, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia will respond to the Netherlands' decision to limit the number of Russian diplomats in the country, TASS news agency reported citing the Russian Foreign Ministry on Saturday. The Netherlands has decided to reduce the number of Russian diplomats working in the country, the country's foreign ministry said earlier on Saturday, adding that the staff cut was due to alleged espionage and unsuccessful talks with Russia on the terms of diplomats' placement. About 10 Russian diplomats would have to leave the Netherlands within two weeks. In March 2022, the Netherlands expelled 17 Russian diplomats for alleged espionage. In response, Russia then ordered 15 Dutch diplomats to leave the country.",Xinhua,2023-02-20 11:44
150,Deaths in U.S. prisons up by 50 pct during 1st COVID-19 year: data,"NEW YORK, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. state and federal prisons saw deaths surging nearly 50 percent during the first year of the pandemic, and in six states they more than doubled, The New York Times reported Sunday, citing the first comprehensive data on prison fatalities in the era of COVID-19. ""The tremendous jump in deaths in 2020 was more than twice the increase in the United States overall, and even exceeded estimates of the percentage increase at nursing homes, among the hardest-hit sectors nationwide,"" said the U.S. daily. While there was ample evidence that prisons were COVID hot spots, the data underscored how quickly the virus rampaged through crowded facilities, and how an aging inmate population, a correctional staffing shortage and ill-equipped medical personnel combined to make prisoners especially vulnerable during the worst public health crisis in a century, according to the report. COVID infections drove the death totals, but inmates also succumbed to other illnesses, suicide and violence, according to the data, which was collected by law school researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles. Altogether, at least 6,182 people died in American prisons in 2020, compared with 4,240 the previous year, even as the country's prison population declined to about 1.3 million from more than 1.4 million, the report said.",Xinhua,2023-02-20 11:49
154,UN allocates 250 mln USD to reach world's most vulnerable people,"UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Saturday announced the largest allocation ever of 250 million U.S. dollars from the United Nations global emergency fund to help the most vulnerable people in some of the most forgotten crises and to stave off famine. ""So often, longstanding development issues can combine with climate chaos, economic shocks and violent conflicts, spinning into a whirlwind of humanitarian disaster,"" said the top UN official. ""Around the world today, 339 million people are in need of humanitarian aid, an increase of more than 25 percent since last year."" The newly announced record 250 million dollars allocation from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) will help people in 19 countries, including Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Haiti, Mali, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen, which are home to more than 20 million people just one step away from famine, according to a UN press release. In addition, the funds will bolster the humanitarian response in underfunded crises in Chad, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Honduras, Kenya, Lebanon, Madagascar, Pakistan and Sudan to combat food insecurity and address the impacts of climate change, it added. ""This money will enable early action, getting ahead of crises in the making, including famines,"" said the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths. ""I thank all donors who have contributed to CERF. You have made this massive allocation possible.""",Xinhua,2023-02-20 13:15

The decision has been taken at a meeting of the Economic Commission with Deputy Prime Minister Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar on the chair, Bakhtar said in its report, adding that the pilot project would begin from Kabul and Balkh, and expand to other parts of the country. The military bases, after turning into economic zones, would be gradually handed over to the Ministry of Commerce and Industries, Bakhtar reported.

137,"Protesters denounce U.S. as ""war machine"" at Washington rally","WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of protesters on Sunday afternoon slammed America's role of ""war machine"" in overseas wars at a rally before the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. Organizers said the anti-war rally was planned to protest against massive money funneling into Ukraine, as well as America's role in the Russia-Ukraine conflicts. ""Billions of taxpayers' dollars are being torched at the altar of U.S. hegemony, the military-industrial complex, and a corrupt Congress,"" a release read. Jimmy Dore, American political commentator and media personality, spoke at Sunday's rally, echoing that America is ""corrupt."" ""Do you know we could end this war today through diplomacy?"" Dore said. ""But our politicians want to enrich weapons manufacturers, so they keep donating to them."" ""The overarching goal of this rally is to stop the war in Ukraine,"" Cat McGuire, a protester from New York City, told Xinhua. ""People have to wake up,"" McGuire said. ""There's massive warmongering propaganda and, unfortunately, too many people have bought into it."" Other speakers and protesters also lashed out at America's military-industrial complex, a powerful interest group made of the military, private defense contractors and politicians. The protesters then marched to the White House after the rally, chanting slogans like ""No NATO, no war."" Eric Reeves, a protester from Texas, said that the military-industrial complex, which has a huge influence on Washington's decision-makers, is ""way out of control."" The U.S. government is ""not doing the will of the American people,"" and ""making decisions without consulting us,"" he complained.",Xinhua,2023-02-20 13:41

139,U.S. Hegemony and Its Perils,"BEIJING, Feb. 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Hegemony and Its Perils February 2023 Contents Introduction I. Political Hegemony -- Throwing Its Weight Around II. Military Hegemony -- Wanton Use of Force III. Economic Hegemony -- Looting and Exploitation IV. Technological Hegemony -- Monopoly and Suppression V. Cultural Hegemony -- Spreading False Narratives Conclusion  Since becoming the world's most powerful country after the two world wars and the Cold War, the United States has acted more boldly to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, pursue, maintain and abuse hegemony, advance subversion and infiltration, and willfully wage wars, bringing harm to the international community. The United States has developed a hegemonic playbook to stage ""color revolutions,"" instigate regional disputes, and even directly launch wars under the guise of promoting democracy, freedom and human rights. Clinging to the Cold War mentality, the United States has ramped up bloc politics and stoked conflict and confrontation. It has overstretched the concept of national security, abused export controls and forced unilateral sanctions upon others. It has taken a selective approach to international law and rules, utilizing or discarding them as it sees fit, and has sought to impose rules that serve its own interests in the name of upholding a ""rules-based international order."" This report, by presenting the relevant facts, seeks to expose the U.S. abuse of hegemony in the political, military, economic, financial, technological and cultural fields, and to draw greater international attention to the perils of the U.S. practices to world peace and stability and the well-being of all peoples.  The United States has long been attempting to mold other countries and the world order with its own values and political system in the name of promoting democracy and human rights. ◆ Instances of U.S. interference in other countries' internal affairs abound. In the name of ""promoting democracy,"" the United States practiced a ""Neo-Monroe Doctrine"" in Latin America, instigated ""color revolutions"" in Eurasia, and orchestrated the ""Arab Spring"" in West Asia and North Africa, bringing chaos and disaster to many countries. In 1823, the United States announced the Monroe Doctrine. While touting an ""America for the Americans,"" what it truly wanted was an ""America for the United States."" Since then, the policies of successive U.S. governments toward Latin America and the Caribbean Region have been riddled with political interference, military intervention and regime subversion. From its 61-year hostility toward and blockade of Cuba to its overthrow of the Allende government of Chile, U.S. policy on this region has been built on one maxim-those who submit will prosper; those who resist shall perish. The year 2003 marked the beginning of a succession of ""color revolutions"" -- the ""Rose Revolution"" in Georgia, the ""Orange Revolution"" in Ukraine and the ""Tulip Revolution"" in Kyrgyzstan. The U.S. Department of State openly admitted playing a ""central role"" in these ""regime changes."" The United States also interfered in the internal affairs of the Philippines, ousting President Ferdinand Marcos Sr. in 1986 and President Joseph Estrada in 2001 through the so-called ""People Power Revolutions."" In January 2023, former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo released his new book Never Give an Inch: Fighting for the America I Love. He revealed in it that the United States had plotted to intervene in Venezuela. The plan was to force the Maduro government to reach an agreement with the opposition, deprive Venezuela of its ability to sell oil and gold for foreign exchange, exert high pressure on its economy, and influence the 2018 presidential election. ◆ The U.S. exercises double standards on international rules. Placing its self-interest first, the United States has walked away from international treaties and organizations, and put its domestic law above international law. In April 2017, the Trump administration announced that it would cut off all U.S. funding to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) with the excuse that the organization ""supports, or participates in the management of a programme of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization."" The United States quit UNESCO twice in 1984 and 2017. In 2017, it announced leaving the Paris Agreement on climate change. In 2018, it announced its exit from the UN Human Rights Council, citing the organization's ""bias"" against Israel and failure to protect human rights effectively. In 2019, the United States announced its withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty to seek unfettered development of advanced weapons. In 2020, it announced pulling out of the Treaty on Open Skies. The United States has also been a stumbling block to biological arms control by opposing negotiations on a verification protocol for the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and impeding international verification of countries' activities relating to biological weapons. As the only country in possession of a chemical weapons stockpile, the United States has repeatedly delayed the destruction of chemical weapons and remained reluctant in fulfilling its obligations. It has become the biggest obstacle to realizing ""a world free of chemical weapons."" ◆ The United States is piecing together small blocs through its alliance system. It has been forcing an ""Indo-Pacific Strategy"" onto the Asia-Pacific region, assembling exclusive clubs like the Five Eyes, the Quad and AUKUS, and forcing regional countries to take sides. Such practices are essentially meant to create division in the region, stoke confrontation and undermine peace. ◆ The U.S. arbitrarily passes judgment on democracy in other countries, and fabricates a false narrative of ""democracy versus authoritarianism"" to incite estrangement, division, rivalry and confrontation. In December 2021, the United States hosted the first ""Summit for Democracy,"" which drew criticism and opposition from many countries for making a mockery of the spirit of democracy and dividing the world. In March 2023, the United States will host another ""Summit for Democracy,"" which remains unwelcome and will again find no support.  The history of the United States is characterized by violence and expansion. Since it gained independence in 1776, the United States has constantly sought expansion by force: it slaughtered Indians, invaded Canada, waged a war against Mexico, instigated the American-Spanish War, and annexed Hawaii. After World War II, the wars either provoked or launched by the United States included the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, the Kosovo War, the War in Afghanistan, the Iraq War, the Libyan War and the Syrian War, abusing its military hegemony to pave the way for expansionist objectives. In recent years, the U.S. average annual military budget has exceeded 700 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 40 percent of the world's total, more than the 15 countries behind it combined. The United States has about 800 overseas military bases, with 173,000 troops deployed in 159 countries. According to the book America Invades: How We've Invaded or been Militarily Involved with almost Every Country on Earth, the United States has fought or been militarily involved with almost all the 190-odd countries recognized by the United Nations with only three exceptions. The three countries were ""spared"" because the United States did not find them on the map. ◆ As former U.S. President Jimmy Carter put it, the United States is undoubtedly the most warlike nation in the history of the world. According to a Tufts University report, ""Introducing the Military Intervention Project: A new Dataset on U.S. Military Interventions, 1776-2019,"" the United States undertook nearly 400 military interventions globally between those years, 34 percent of which were in Latin America and the Caribbean, 23 percent in East Asia and the Pacific, 14 percent in the Middle East and North Africa, and 13 percent in Europe. Currently, its military intervention in the Middle East and North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa is on the rise. Alex Lo, a South China Morning Post columnist, pointed out that the United States has rarely distinguished between diplomacy and war since its founding. It overthrew democratically elected governments in many developing countries in the 20th century and immediately replaced them with pro-American puppet regimes. Today, in Ukraine, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Pakistan and Yemen, the United States is repeating its old tactics of waging proxy, low-intensity, and drone wars. ◆ U.S. military hegemony has caused humanitarian tragedies. Since 2001, the wars and military operations launched by the United States in the name of fighting terrorism have claimed over 900,000 lives with some 335,000 of them civilians, injured millions and displaced tens of millions. The 2003 Iraq War resulted in some 200,000 to 250,000 civilian deaths, including over 16,000 directly killed by the U.S. military, and left more than a million homeless. The United States has created 37 million refugees around the world. Since 2012, the number of Syrian refugees alone has increased tenfold. Between 2016 and 2019, 33,584 civilian deaths were documented in the Syrian fightings, including 3,833 killed by U.S.-led coalition bombings, half of them women and children. The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) reported on 9 November 2018 that the air strikes launched by U.S. forces on Raqqa alone killed 1,600 Syrian civilians. The two-decades-long war in Afghanistan devastated the country. A total of 47,000 Afghan civilians and 66,000 to 69,000 Afghan soldiers and police officers unrelated to the September 11 attacks were killed in U.S. military operations, and more than 10 million people were displaced. The war in Afghanistan destroyed the foundation of economic development there and plunged the Afghan people into destitution. After the ""Kabul debacle"" in 2021, the United States announced that it would freeze some 9.5 billion dollars in assets belonging to the Afghan central bank, a move considered as ""pure looting."" In September 2022, Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu commented at a rally that the United States has waged a proxy war in Syria, turned Afghanistan into an opium field and heroin factory, thrown Pakistan into turmoil, and left Libya in incessant civil unrest. The United States does whatever it takes to rob and enslave the people of any country with underground resources. The United States has also adopted appalling methods in war. During the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, the Kosovo War, the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War, the United States used massive quantities of chemical and biological weapons as well as cluster bombs, fuel-air bombs, graphite bombs and depleted uranium bombs, causing enormous damage on civilian facilities, countless civilian casualties and lasting environmental pollution.  After World War II, the United States led efforts to set up the Bretton Woods System, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which, together with the Marshall Plan, formed the international monetary system centered around the U.S. dollar. In addition, the United States has also established institutional hegemony in the international economic and financial sector by manipulating the weighted voting systems, rules and arrangements of international organizations including ""approval by 85 percent majority,"" and its domestic trade laws and regulations. By taking advantage of the dollar's status as the major international reserve currency, the United States is basically collecting ""seigniorage"" from around the world; and using its control over international organizations, it coerces other countries into serving America's political and economic strategy. ◆ The United States exploits the world's wealth with the help of ""seigniorage."" It costs only about 17 cents to produce a 100 dollar bill, but other countries had to pony up 100 dollar of actual goods in order to obtain one. It was pointed out more than half a century ago, that the United States enjoyed exorbitant privilege and deficit without tears created by its dollar, and used the worthless paper note to plunder the resources and factories of other nations. ◆ The hegemony of U.S. dollar is the main source of instability and uncertainty in the world economy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States abused its global financial hegemony and injected trillions of dollars into the global market, leaving other countries, especially emerging economies, to pay the price. In 2022, the Fed ended its ultra-easy monetary policy and turned to aggressive interest rate hike, causing turmoil in the international financial market and substantial depreciation of other currencies such as the Euro, many of which dropped to a 20-year low. As a result, a large number of developing countries were challenged by high inflation, currency depreciation and capital outflows. This was exactly what Nixon's secretary of the treasury John Connally once remarked, with self-satisfaction yet sharp precision, that ""the dollar is our currency, but it is your problem."" ◆ With its control over international economic and financial organizations, the United States imposes additional conditions to their assistance to other countries. In order to reduce obstacles to U.S. capital inflow and speculation, the recipient countries are required to advance financial liberalization and open up financial markets so that their economic policies would fall in line with America's strategy. According to the Review of International Political Economy, along with the 1,550 debt relief programs extended by the IMF to its 131 member countries from 1985 to 2014, as many as 55,465 additional political conditions had been attached. ◆ The United States willfully suppresses its opponents with economic coercion. In the 1980s, to eliminate the economic threat posed by Japan, and to control and use the latter in service of America's strategic goal of confronting the Soviet Union and dominating the world, the United States leveraged its hegemonic financial power against Japan, and concluded the Plaza Accord. As a result, Yen was pushed up, and Japan was pressed to open up its financial market and reform its financial system. The Plaza Accord dealt a heavy blow to the growth momentum of the Japanese economy, leaving Japan to what was later called ""three lost decades."" ◆ America's economic and financial hegemony has become a geopolitical weapon. Doubling down on unilateral sanctions and ""long-arm jurisdiction,"" the United States has enacted such domestic laws as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, and the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, and introduced a series of executive orders to sanction specific countries, organizations or individuals. Statistics show that U.S. sanctions against foreign entities increased by 933 percent from 2000 to 2021. The Trump administration alone has imposed more than 3,900 sanctions, which means three sanctions per day. So far, the United States had or has imposed economic sanctions on nearly 40 countries across the world, including Cuba, China, Russia, the DPRK, Iran and Venezuela, affecting nearly half of the world's population. ""The United States of America"" has turned itself into ""the United States of Sanctions."" And ""long-arm jurisdiction"" has been reduced to nothing but a tool for the United States to use its means of state power to suppress economic competitors and interfere in normal international business. This is a serious departure from the principles of liberal market economy that the United States has long boasted.  The United States seeks to deter other countries' scientific, technological and economic development by wielding monopoly power, suppression measures and technology restrictions in high-tech fields. ◆ The United States monopolizes intellectual property in the name of protection. Taking advantage of the weak position of other countries, especially developing ones, on intellectual property rights and the institutional vacancy in relevant fields, the United States reaps excessive profits through monopoly. In 1994, the United States pushed forward the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), forcing the Americanized process and standards in intellectual property protection in an attempt to solidify its monopoly on technology. In the 1980s, to contain the development of Japan's semiconductor industry, the United States launched the ""301"" investigation, built bargaining power in bilateral negotiations through multilateral agreements, threatened to label Japan as conducting unfair trade, and imposed retaliatory tariffs, forcing Japan to sign the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement. As a result, Japanese semiconductor enterprises were almost completely driven out of global competition, and their market share dropped from 50 percent to 10 percent. Meanwhile, with the support of the U.S. government, a large number of U.S. semiconductor enterprises took the opportunity and grabbed larger market share. ◆ The United States politicizes, weaponizes technological issues and uses them as ideological tools. Overstretching the concept of national security, the United States mobilized state power to suppress and sanction Chinese company Huawei, restricted the entry of Huawei products into the U.S. market, cut off its supply of chips and operating systems, and coerced other countries to ban Huawei from undertaking local 5G network construction. It even talked Canada into unwarrantedly detaining Huawei's CFO Meng Wanzhou for nearly three years. The United States has fabricated a slew of excuses to clamp down on China's high-tech enterprises with global competitiveness, and has put more than 1,000 Chinese enterprises on sanction lists. In addition, the United States has also imposed controls on biotechnology, artificial intelligence and other high-end technologies, reinforced export restrictions, tightened investment screening, suppressed Chinese social media apps such as TikTok and WeChat, and lobbied the Netherlands and Japan to restrict exports of chips and related equipment or technology to China. The United States has also practiced double standards in its policy on China-related technological professionals. To sideline and suppress Chinese researchers, since June 2018, visa validity has been shortened for Chinese students majoring in certain high-tech-related disciplines, repeated cases have occurred where Chinese scholars and students going to the United States for exchange programs and study were unjustifiably denied and harassed, and large-scale investigation on Chinese scholars working in the United States was carried out. ◆ The United States solidifies its technological monopoly in the name of protecting democracy. By building small blocs on technology such as the ""chips alliance"" and ""clean network,"" the United States has put ""democracy"" and ""human rights"" labels on high-technology, and turned technological issues into political and ideological issues, so as to fabricate excuses for its technological blockade against other countries. In May 2019, the United States enlisted 32 countries to the Prague 5G Security Conference in the Czech Republic and issued the Prague Proposal in an attempt to exclude China's 5G products. In April 2020, then U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the ""5G clean path,"" a plan designed to build technological alliance in the 5G field with partners bonded by their shared ideology on democracy and the need to protect ""cyber security."" The measures, in essence, are the U.S. attempts to maintain its technological hegemony through technological alliances. ◆ The United States abuses its technological hegemony by carrying out cyber attacks and eavesdropping. The United States has long been notorious as an ""empire of hackers,"" blamed for its rampant acts of cyber theft around the world. It has all kinds of means to enforce pervasive cyber attacks and surveillance, including using analog base station signals to access mobile phones for data theft, manipulating mobile apps, infiltrating cloud servers, and stealing through undersea cables. The list goes on. U.S. surveillance is indiscriminate. All can be targets of its surveillance, be they rivals or allies, even leaders of allied countries such as former German Chancellor Angela Merkel and several French Presidents. Cyber surveillance and attacks launched by the United States such as ""Prism,"" ""Dirtbox,"" ""Irritant Horn"" and ""Telescreen Operation"" are all proof that the United States is closely monitoring its allies and partners. Such eavesdropping on allies and partners has already caused worldwide outrage. Julian Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, a website that has exposed U.S. surveillance programs, said that ""do not expect a global surveillance superpower to act with honor or respect. There is only one rule: there are no rules.""  The global expansion of American culture is an important part of its external strategy. The United States has often used cultural tools to strengthen and maintain its hegemony in the world. ◆ The United States embeds American values in its products such as movies. American values and lifestyle are a tied product to its movies and TV shows, publications, media content, and programs by the government-funded non-profit cultural institutions. It thus shapes a cultural and public opinion space in which American culture reigns and maintains cultural hegemony. In his article The Americanization of the World, John Yemma, an American scholar, exposed the real weapons in U.S. cultural expansion: the Hollywood, the image design factories on Madison Avenue and the production lines of Mattel Company and Coca-Cola. There are various vehicles the United States uses to keep its cultural hegemony. American movies are the most used; they now occupy more than 70 percent of the world's market share. The United States skilfully exploits its cultural diversity to appeal to various ethnicities. When Hollywood movies descend on the world, they scream the American values tied to them. ◆ American cultural hegemony not only shows itself in ""direct intervention,"" but also in ""media infiltration"" and as ""a trumpet for the world."" U.S.-dominated Western media has a particularly important role in shaping global public opinion in favor of U.S. meddling in the internal affairs of other countries. The U.S. government strictly censors all social media companies and demands their obedience. Twitter CEO Elon Musk admitted on 27 December 2022 that all social media platforms work with the U.S. government to censor content, reported Fox Business Network. Public opinion in the United States is subject to government intervention to restrict all unfavorable remarks. Google often makes pages disappear. U.S. Department of Defense manipulates social media. In December 2022, The Intercept, an independent U.S. investigative website, revealed that in July 2017, U.S. Central Command official Nathaniel Kahler instructed Twitter's public policy team to augment the presence of 52 Arabic-language accounts on a list he sent, six of which were to be given priority. One of the six was dedicated to justifying U.S. drone attacks in Yemen, such as by claiming that the attacks were precise and killed only terrorists, not civilians. Following Kahler's directive, Twitter put those Arabic-language accounts on a ""white list"" to amplify certain messages. ◆The United States practices double standards on the freedom of the press. It brutally suppresses and silences media of other countries by various means. The United States and Europe bar mainstream Russian media such as Russia Today and the Sputnik from their countries. Platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube openly restrict official accounts of Russia. Netflix, Apple and Google have removed Russian channels and applications from their services and app stores. Unprecedented draconian censorship is imposed on Russia-related contents. ◆The United States abuses its cultural hegemony to instigate ""peaceful evolution"" in socialist countries. It sets up news media and cultural outfits targeting socialist countries. It pours staggering amounts of public funds into radio and TV networks to support their ideological infiltration, and these mouthpieces bombard socialist countries in dozens of languages with inflammatory propaganda day and night. The United States uses misinformation as a spear to attack other countries, and has built an industrial chain around it: there are groups and individuals making up stories, and peddling them worldwide to mislead public opinion with the support of nearly limitless financial resources.  While a just cause wins its champion wide support, an unjust one condemns its pursuer to be an outcast. The hegemonic, domineering, and bullying practices of using strength to intimidate the weak, taking from others by force and subterfuge, and playing zero-sum games are exerting grave harm. The historical trends of peace, development, cooperation, and mutual benefit are unstoppable. The United States has been overriding truth with its power and trampling justice to serve self-interest. These unilateral, egoistic and regressive hegemonic practices have drawn growing, intense criticism and opposition from the international community. Countries need to respect each other and treat each other as equals. Big countries should behave in a manner befitting their status and take the lead in pursuing a new model of state-to-state relations featuring dialogue and partnership, not confrontation or alliance. China opposes all forms of hegemonism and power politics, and rejects interference in other countries' internal affairs. The United States must conduct serious soul-searching. It must critically examine what it has done, let go of its arrogance and prejudice, and quit its hegemonic, domineering and bullying practices.",Xinhua,2023-02-20 15:31
138,Naxals kill 2 policemen in India's Chhattisgarh,"NEW DELHI, Feb. 20 (Xinhua) -- Two policemen were killed Monday in a Naxal attack in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, police said. The duo was killed in Bortalab area of Rajnandgaon district, about 125 km west of Raipur, the capital city of Chhattisgarh. ""This morning a group of Naxalites fired upon two policemen in Bortalav police limits. While one policeman was killed on the spot, the other succumbed later on while being removed to hospital,"" Abhishek Meena, a senior police official told media. Reports said the policemen were heading to Bortalab police camp on a motorcycle when they came under attack. Following the killings, contingents of police and paramilitary rushed to the area to carry out searches for the attackers. Currently, Naxals are active across the central and eastern parts of India. New Delhi has deployed several companies of its paramilitary forces to take on Naxals in their strongholds. The insurgency reportedly has claimed hundreds of lives besides rendering thousands of poor inhabitants homeless.",Xinhua,2023-02-20 16:01
235,Ohio derailment triggers long-simmering tensions in U.S.: media,"   NEW YORK, Feb. 20 (Xinhua) -- When a Norfolk Southern Corp. train derailed earlier this month, creating a fiery crash that spilled chemicals across a small town in the U.S. state of Ohio, long-simmering tensions in the United States were ignited, reported The Meadville Tribune on Saturday. ""While the crash didn't cause any injuries or deaths, it has become a focal point of grievances and suspicions,"" it said, noting that ""some have said corporate greed is taking precedence over rail safety and environmental protection."" Train safety was already a flashpoint before the Norfolk Southern crash. Large railroads in the country shed more than 40,000 workers since 2016 under a strategy called Precision Scheduled Railroading. That boosted profits but ruffled customers, who had to adjust their schedules for freight pickup, and angered workers, who were stretched thin, according to the morning daily newspaper published in Meadville, Pennsylvania. U.S. train derailments dropped to 1,093 last year, from 2,435 in 2004, which still means there are about three derailments a day, said the report, adding that ""each of those accidents carry risk.""",Xinhua,2023-02-21 08:23
126,Biden makes surprise trip to Kiev amid anti-war rally at home,"  KIEV, Feb. 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Joe Biden made an unannounced visit here on Monday, one day after demonstrators rallied in Washington to protest against the United States' war-mongering foreign policy and its role in various conflicts across the globe. Biden held talks with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, about the situation on the frontline in Ukraine and announced an additional 500 U.S. million dollars in military aid for Ukraine on top of the more than 50 billion dollars already promised, a move that is widely believed to further escalate the Ukraine crisis. While speaking at a joint press conference with Zelensky, Biden said the new assistance package will consist of missiles for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and Javelin anti-tank missile systems, as well as more military equipment and weapons. The United States and its allies have already committed nearly 700 tanks and thousands of armored vehicles and 1,000 artillery systems, among other aid to Ukraine, Biden said. For his part, Zelensky said the war must end with the full de-occupation of Ukrainian territories and security guarantees for Ukraine. Biden's trip, which came four days ahead of the first anniversary of the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, is designed to show solidarity with Ukraine. The brief visit also came at a time when more people in the United States and beyond are growing wary of the U.S. role in the year-long conflict. Hundreds of protesters on Sunday afternoon slammed the United States' role of ""war machine"" in overseas wars at a rally before the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. Organizers said the anti-war rally was planned to protest against massive money being funneled into Ukraine, as well as the United States' role in the Russia-Ukraine military conflict. ""Billions of taxpayers' dollars are being torched at the altar of U.S. hegemony, the military-industrial complex, and a corrupt Congress,"" a release read. The protesters then marched to the White House after the rally, chanting slogans like ""No NATO, no war."" Public distrust of U.S. authorities has also been fueled by a hazmat train derailment in a Ohio village on Feb. 3 and a deadly Texas train derailment on Feb. 13.",Xinhua,2023-02-21 08:42
125,"Strong earthquakes hit Türkiye, Syria again, 2 weeks after tragic quakes","ANKARA/DAMASCUS, Feb. 20 (Xinhua) -- A magnitude 6.4 earthquake struck southern Türkiye on Monday night, the country's disaster agency said, two weeks after two strong quakes jolted the region. The quake was centered in Defne district of the Hatay province which borders Syria. A 5.8 shock followed the first quake in Samandag district of Hatay, the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) said. The province was already hit severely by dual quakes on Feb.6. Meanwhile, the Syrian National Earthquake Center reported that a magnitude 6.3 earthquake was felt in several Syrian areas on Monday night. The report said the earthquake struck at 20:04 pm local time (1704 GMT), adding that the epicenter of the earthquake was the Hatay province in Türkiye. Reports emerging from Aleppo and Latakia provinces, both were hard hit by the Feb. 6 earthquake, said that there is a state of panic in the two provinces with no immediate reports on losses or possible collapses. A magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck Türkiye's southern province of Kahramanmaras at 4:17 a.m. local time (0117 GMT), followed by a magnitude 6.4 quake a few minutes later in the country's southern province of Gaziantep and a magnitude 7.6 earthquake at 1:24 p.m. local time (1024 GMT) in the Kahramanmaras Province.",Xinhua,2023-02-21 08:45

119,UN Security Council calls for de-escalation of Israeli-Palestinian tensions,"  UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 20 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council on Monday adopted a presidential statement, calling for the de-escalation of tensions between Israelis and Palestinians. ""The Security Council calls on all parties to observe calm and restraint, and to refrain from provocative actions, incitement and inflammatory rhetoric, with the aim, inter alia, of de-escalating the situation on the ground, rebuilding trust and confidence, demonstrating through policies and actions a genuine commitment to the two-state solution, and creating the conditions necessary for promoting peace,"" said the presidential statement. The Security Council condemns all acts of violence against civilians, including acts of terrorism, and calls for the strengthening of ongoing efforts to counter terrorism in a manner consistent with international law, and for all parties to clearly condemn all acts of terrorism and refrain from incitement to violence, it said. The Security Council reiterates the obligation of all parties regarding the pursuit of accountability for all acts of violence targeting civilians, and recalls the obligation of the Palestinian Authority to renounce and confront terror, it said. The Security Council expresses deep concern and dismay with Israel's announcement on Feb. 12 for further construction and expansion of settlements and the ""legalization"" of settlement outposts. The council reiterates that continuing Israeli settlement activities are dangerously imperiling the viability of the two-state solution, said the statement. The council strongly underscores the need for all parties to meet their international obligations and commitments; strongly opposes all unilateral measures that impede peace, including Israeli construction and expansion of settlements, confiscation of Palestinians' land, and the ""legalization"" of settlement outposts, demolition of Palestinians' homes and displacement of Palestinian civilians, it said. The Security Council notes with deep concern instances of discrimination, intolerance and hate speech motivated by racism or directed against persons belonging to religious communities, in particular, cases motivated by Islamophobia, antisemitism or Christianophobia, it said. The Security Council calls for upholding unchanged the historic status quo at the holy sites in Jerusalem in word and in practice, and emphasizes in this regard the special role of Jordan, said the statement.

118,U.S. residents demand answers after train derailment: BBC,"LONDON, Feb. 20 (Xinhua) -- Local residents are still demanding answers nearly two weeks after a train carrying toxic chemicals derailed in the small Ohio town of East Palestine, the United States, the BBC has reported. Even though officials including Governor Mike DeWine have assured the residents that air quality in the town was safe, confusion and distrust still remain, according to the BBC report. Residents in the immediate area have complained of headaches and nausea more than a week after the chemicals were burned, according to various U.S. local reports. Environmental experts told the BBC they had misgivings about the government's decision to allow people to return to East Palestine so soon after the crash and controlled burn. ""It certainly feels like state and local regulators moved too quickly to give the green light to people to go back,"" David Masur, executive director of the PennEnvironment Research &Policy Center, was quoted as saying. ""That builds a lot of distrust and scepticism from the public about trusting these agencies, which is a problem,"" he said.",Xinhua,2023-02-21 08:56
121,"From Nord Stream to Syria sanction, U.S. interventions are damaging the world","The world is unsettled with earthquakes causing severe damage in Türkiye and Syria, Pulitzer winner journalist Seymour Hersh disclosing that the U.S. Navy is behind the Nord Stream 2 pipeline explosion, and a Chinese airship's force majeure entry into U.S. airspace triggering another round of U.S. hostility against China. As of Monday, the death toll in Türkiye and Syria caused by the earthquake on February 6 and its aftershocks has risen above 33,000. The U.S. on Thursday changed its policies, giving a 180-day exemption to its sanctions on Syria for ""all transactions related to earthquake relief efforts"" due to international pressure. However, the 72-hour ""golden window"" has long passed, and the 180-day exemption is hardly a respite compared to Syria's 12 years of suffering.  On February 6, a magnitude-7.8 earthquake struck south-central Türkiye near the Türkiye-Syria border. In Syria, the disaster has left many people, who had already been displaced several times by a decade-old civil war, homeless yet again. Steven Sahiounie, a Syrian American freelance journalist and chief editor of Mideast Discourse, told CGTN that in Aleppo, 400,000 people lost their homes and that in Lattakia city, where he lives, 150,000 people also lost their homes. ""People are dying in the hospitals and are injured because there is no medical, and they cannot get any medicine. As I said before, Syria has had 12 years of war, so the medical system is very weak,"" Sahiounie said. According to China Media Group's (CMG) correspondent in Syria, U.S. sanctions are causing serious difficulties in the aftermath of the earthquake, most notably shortages of oil and diesel. The reporter said the Syrian government had been unable to secure any oil supplies since January, and it had to redistribute diesel fuel used for heating to heavy vehicles used for rescue after the earthquake. In addition, 70 percent of Syria's medical workers have fled the country because of years of fighting and sanctions. He said medicine and materials for medicine-making cannot reach the epicenter due to U.S. sanctions. The U.S. has imposed sanctions on Syria since 1979 when the Syrian army got involved in Lebanon, and the U.S. designated it as a ""state sponsor of terrorism."" In 2011, the U.S. government imposed additional sanctions on current Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government after mass protests erupted in the country, leading to an outbreak of civil war. Following the U.S., the European Council also imposed sanctions on Syria in 2011. Kevork Almassia, a political analyst on the YouTube channel Syriana Analysis who now lives in Berlin, said in many Western countries, people don't realize that sanctions on Syria have blocked humanitarian aid and medicine and reconstruction materials to Syria as ""the governments here are in full control of the influential media outlet,"" and ""there is a united narrative when it comes to important issues, such as Syria, such as China, such as Russia, Ukraine, et cetera."" Alena Douhan, a UN-appointed independent human rights expert, in November, presented detailed informationon the catastrophic effects of sanctions on all aspects of life for the Syrian people following her 12-day visit to the country. She reported that 90 percent of Syria's population is currently living below the poverty line, pointing to their limited access to food, water, electricity, shelter, cooking and heating fuel, transportation, and healthcare. At the same time, blocking bank payments and refusing deliveries by foreign producers, coupled with sanctions-induced limited foreign currency reserves, have caused severe shortages in medicines and specialized medical equipment, particularly to treat chronic and rare diseases. The economic and financial sanctions imposed by the U.S. on other countries have seen exponential growth since the September 11 attacks. By the end of the fiscal year 2021, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on 9,421 entities and individuals, up 933 percent from 2000. The Donald Trump administration alone has imposed more than 3,900 sanctions, equivalent to three a day, according to the 2021 Sanctions Review report released by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in October 2021.  Aside from draconian sanctions, U.S. interventions in other countries are also embodied in its mass surveillance of other countries. Recently, the U.S. accused China of spying on its country by letting a ""surveillance balloon"" fly into its airspace, which triggered the immediate delay of U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to China despite the fact that China has repeatedly said it's a total accident and the airship is a civilian airship for meteorological purposes. The Chinese side also called on the U.S. to handle the accident in a ""cool-headed"" manner and not overreact, but the U.S. side eventually shot it down. U.S. officials also claimed on Wednesday that China, in this way, is collecting intelligence in more than 40 countries without giving any evidence. During Wednesday's news briefing, a reporter from Associated Press asked U.S. Department of State spokesperson Ned Price to give the other 39 names of these countries and how the U.S. government knows that the other 39 countries' airspace sovereignties are being violated if the U.S. is not spying on the 39 countries. Price refused to answer, saying giving out the sources will ""weaken our defenses against programs like this."" However, more and more evidence shows that the U.S. government is the world's biggest surveillance body. In 2013, documents leaked by former contractor for the Central Intelligence Agency Edward Snowden revealed that the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) was tracking online communication via major technology companies, including Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo. The surveillance program is known as Prism. And Britain's electronic eavesdropping agency GCHQ was also tapping global communications and sharing the data with the NSA. The U.S. government not only spies on its people but also on other countries and world leaders. Snowden also disclosed that 38 embassies and missions have been ""targets"" of U.S. spying operations. Countries targeted included Belgium, France, Italy, Greece, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia and Chile, as well as America's non-European allies such as Japan, South Korea and India. The NSA had also monitored the phones of 35 world leaders, including then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel. After fleeing to China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), Snowden told the South China Morning Post that the NSA also had hacking operations in Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, saying targets in Hong Kong included the Chinese University, public officials and businesses. Charles W. Freeman, a retired American diplomat who had served in the State and Defense Departments of the U.S., told CMG that he knows many people in the intelligence community, none of whom agree with the so-called balloon ""surveillance"" claim and that the balloon hype is a small group of neoconservatives manufacturing evidence and falsely claiming that China is spying on the U.S.  Contrasting with the balloon hype, the recent breaking news by Seymour Hersh alleging that U.S. Navy divers laid bombs that destroyed the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea last September barely drew any attention. The U.S. mainstream media is keeping a collective silence on the astonishing disclosure, aligning themselves with the U.S. government on the issue. Hersh, a former New York Times and New Yorker reporter who won numerous awards for his investigative journalism, including the My Lai massacre of Vietnamese civilians by U.S. troops in 1968 and the 2004 Abu Ghraib scandal following the U.S. invasion of Iraq, cited an unnamed source reporting that the decision to bomb the pipelines was made in secret by U.S. President Joe Biden to cut off Moscow's ability to earn billions of dollars from natural gas sales to Europe. The U.S. believed that the pipelines gave Russia political leverage over Germany and Western Europe that could be used to weaken their commitment to Ukraine after the Russia-Ukraine conflict began, according to Hersh. The extent of the damage means the Nord Stream pipelines are unlikely to be able to carry any gas to Europe in the winter. Plunging Russian gas supplies have caused prices to soar in Europe, where countries have struggled to find alternative energy supplies to heat homes, generate electricity and run factories. And the leak also worried environmentalists as the pipelines contained pressurized natural gas, the vast majority of which is methane. The escape of the greenhouse gas would also cause grave damage to the ozone layer and further impact global warming. CMG researched the number of reports on the Chinese balloon and Nord Stream pipeline explosion and found that there are over 10,825 reports about the Chinese balloon from Western media outlets from February 3 to 5, while there were only 1,552 reports from February 8 to 10 about Hersh's disclosure of Nord Stream 2 pipeline explosion. Also, compared with last September's reports when the pipeline explosion was first found, the largest daily number of reports on it surpassed 1,800 on September 29, while the largest daily number of reports on Hersh's latest disclosure barely reached 200 on February 8. Mainstream U.S. media has always claimed that they seek the truth, fairness and balance in their reports, but sometimes, when it comes to things that matter, it seems that they tell the public nothing.", (CGTN) ,2023-02-21 10:11
120,75% of respondents believe U.S. is behind Nord Stream sabotage,"According to a global opinion poll recently launched by CGTN Think Tank, 75 percent of respondents believed the U.S. was behind Nord Stream sabotage based on the information and relevant evidence released so far. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh recently disclosed that the United States ordered the attack of the Nord Stream gas pipelines last year, which aroused wide attention in the world. Nord Stream, an ""energy lifeline"" for Europe, was a critical network of pipelines that carried natural gas from Russia to Europe under the sea. About 71 percent of respondents considered that the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines has hindered Russia's energy exports, thus harming its national interests. While, 72 percent worried that plunging Russian gas supplies would threaten European energy security. Moreover, on a global scale, 85 percent of respondents predicted that the Nord Stream incident will exacerbate the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, according to the poll. In the survey, 79 percent of respondents believed the U.S. was the largest beneficiary of the incident, for many European countries have turned to the U.S. for more expensive alternative energy after the explosion. Meanwhile, some 88 percent of respondents condemned the sabotage on civilian facilities with ulterior motives as an act of terrorism, and the perpetrators owes the world a sincere apology and a responsible explanation.", (CGTN) ,2023-02-21 10:24
122,"Voices on U.S. hysteria over China's airship as ludicrous, unwarranted","BEIJING, Feb. 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. allegations regarding China's airship are ludicrous, unwarranted and dangerous, various voices have pointed out recently. Washington has leveled ""ludicrous allegations"" of China's civilian unmanned airship violating ""territorial integrity,"" Iranian daily newspaper Tehran Times has commented. A spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry has told a daily news briefing on Wednesday that the entry of a Chinese civilian unmanned airship into U.S. airspace is an entirely unintended, unexpected and isolated event caused by force majeure. Experts had said the same thing, namely that the hard-to-maneuver and high-altitude weather test balloon was blown by winds across North America, the Tehran Times reported. U.S. accusations are ""actually quite laughable"" as balloons were used for surveillance purposes some 70 to 80 years ago, the report added. The U.S. hysterical overreaction to the Chinese balloon incident shows the world that the U.S. administration lacks sufficient strength and capability to engage Beijing constructively, said retired U.S. career diplomat Chas Freeman in a recent interview with Russia's Sputnik news agency. It has made it clear that the administration is ""too weak to stand up to partisan criticism in a deeply polarized American society,"" said Freeman, who served as late U.S. President Richard Nixon's interpreter during his 1972 trip to China. The Washington Post has said in an opinion piece that the frenzy over China's airship is dangerous and unwarranted. The author (Max Boot, columnist) wrote that the use of the most advanced U.S. weapons systems, an F-22 Raptor, to shoot down the airship left him feeling unsettled and alarmed. ""What concerns me is the hysterical overreaction on the part of so many Americans to the balloon's progress,"" wrote the author, who argued that paranoia and alarmism about China's growing power are unwarranted. A Bloomberg report revealed that Republicans in the United States are using the China airship drama to raise money for 2024. Republican politicians are stoking outrage and raising cash over the alleged ""spy balloon"" that crossed the United States before it was shot down, the report said. According to the report, congressional campaigns cited the incident in at least 11 emails as they ask recipients for money, to sign petitions or to take surveys. Venezuelan condemned what it called an ""attack by the United States against an unmanned civilian aircraft of Chinese origin,"" according to a Venezuela Foreign Ministry statement.

Speaking at a joint news conference with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in the Turkish capital of Ankara, Mevlut Cavusoglu said Türkiye is not sure about Sweden's admission into the military alliance, since it has yet to take enough steps to meet Türkiye's concerns. Cavusoglu argued that although Sweden conveyed some positive messages, ""PKK supporters are still present in Sweden. They are recruiting people; they are financing terror acts."" He was speaking of the Kurdistan Workers' Party which Türkiye considers a terrorist group. The Turkish minister reiterated that Ankara's stance on Finland's accession could be different and that its membership could be ratified earlier. Blinken, speaking earlier at the press conference, said the United States strongly supported Sweden and Finland's accession into the alliance ""as quickly as possible"". ""Finland and Sweden already have taken concrete steps to fulfill the commitments they made under the trilateral agreement ... We welcome those steps which are significant,"" Blinken added. Cavusoglu responded that all parties in NATO must convince Sweden in particular to take more action to address Türkiye's concerns. ""If Sweden can take some positive steps then we can convince our parliament, our people and only after that we can say yes for their membership,"" he added. Finland and Sweden applied to join NATO in May 2022 in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Their accession to NATO needs the approval of all member states of the military alliance. Türkiye and Hungary, both members of NATO, are holding back their approvals.

Hossein Amir-Abdollahian made the remarks in a phone call with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on Sunday night, in response to recent EU sanctions imposed on Iran, the Iranian Foreign Ministry's website reported on Monday. The EU imposed sanctions on more than 30 Iranian officials and organizations in late January, including units of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, for their response to the recent protests in the country. Britain and the United States also slapped new sanctions on Iran. Regarding Iran's interaction with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the safeguards issues, the Iranian top diplomat said Tehran is preparing for a visit to Iran by IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi and joint initiatives are scheduled during his visit. Iran signed the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), with world powers in July 2015, agreeing to put some curbs on its nuclear program in return for the removal of the sanctions on the country. The United States, however, pulled out of the deal in May 2018 and reimposed its unilateral sanctions on Tehran, prompting the latter to reduce some of its nuclear commitments under the deal. The talks on the JCPOA's revival began in April 2021 in Vienna. No breakthrough has been achieved after the latest round of talks in August 2022.",Xinhua,2023-02-21 11:08

129,"Interview: Russia-Ukraine conflict, a U.S.-imposed ""proxy war"" on Europe: Hungarian expert","BUDAPEST, Feb. 20 (Xinhua) -- The conflict between Russia and Ukraine is a ""proxy war"" that the United States (U.S.) has imposed on Europe, Zoltan Kiszelly, director of the Center of Political Analyses at Hungary's Szazadveg Institute, told Xinhua in a recent interview on the eve of the first anniversary of the outbreak of the conflict. According to Kiszelly, the U.S. is ""the main supporter of Ukraine with weapons and money,"" making the conflict a ""proxy war"" between Russia and the West, or to be more precise, between Russia and the U.S.. ""In this 'proxy war' in Europe, the U.S. is pressuring Europeans to support Ukraine,"" he said. However, Western Europe is not accustomed to participating in military operations, and as a result, military spending has decreased over the past several decades of peace, making it less able to provide Ukraine with the necessary military hardware, Kiszelly said. Kiszelly said that a grave consequence of the Russia-Ukraine conflict could be a world divided into two parts, an Anglo-Saxon part, with the European Union (EU) and some Asian countries, representing the bloc that imposed sanctions on Russia. The other part, the East, is made up of the other two-thirds of the world, or all the other nations that chose to stay out of the conflict and abstain from the sanctions. ""Two-thirds of the world is not joining the sanctions because they think it is only a tool for the West to increase their influence,"" Kiszelly said, adding that the Eastern countries want to have free trade the way China has proposed. The Hungarian expert also warned that such political split could lead to a technological split: ""instead of one worldwide standard, we will have two standards: an Eastern one and a Western one."" And this dual system would not only endanger global free trade but also have dire consequences for Europe too, Kiszelly noted, adding that Europe, whose digital industry is less developed, would suffer and also fail in the international competition of innovation. The U.S. only views Europe as a sort of secondary home market, a ""backyard"" where it can sell its products, and a place where it can strengthen the dollar's position, Kiszelly said. Kiszelly hopes that Hungary's position, a call for an immediate ceasefire, will later be adopted by the majority of the European countries, and hopefully, by the U.S. following the 2024 presidential elections.",Xinhua,2023-02-21 13:03
128,China says int'l community has right to demand thorough probe into Nord Stream blast,"BEIJING, Feb. 20 (Xinhua) -- The international community has right to demand a thorough investigation into the Nord Stream pipelines blast that seriously sabotaged vital transnational infrastructure and caused severe consequences, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Monday. Wang said it is extremely necessary to conduct an objective, impartial and professional investigation into the blast of the gas pipelines, once regarded as the lifeline of energy for Europe, because the explosions have had a serious impact on the global energy market and ecological environment. The spokesperson made the comment in response to latest reports and remarks in support of American investigative journalist Seymour Hersh who disclosed the details of U.S. involvement in the explosions in late September last year. John Dugan, an American journalist, reportedly received an anonymous mail from the U.S. military, saying that during Baltops-2022, a NATO military exercise held in Denmark in June last year, U.S. deep-sea divers ""disappeared underwater for more than six hours"" with a box. Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University also said that the U.S. ""was basically the only country with the motive, the means"" to end Nord Stream. Former Advisor to the French defense ministry Alain Corvez said that from the political and economic perspective, the United States is the major beneficiary of the incident. ""In the wake of these revelations, The U.S. government and media have been mysteriously quiet and the countries concerned in Europe seem rather hesitant about how they would react,"" Wang said. These unusual signs give people even more reason to believe that the truth behind the Nord Stream blast is more complicated than they can imagine, he added. ""Given the gravity of sabotaging vital transnational infrastructure and the serious consequences arising thereof, the international community has every right to demand a thorough investigation into this,"" he said.",Xinhua,2023-02-21 13:24

Police say they believe the two scenes are connected, but no suspect has been arrested yet. At a local bar, police found two critically injured persons. Later, at another location, a deceased victim and three more injured persons were found. Gun violence has become one of the most serious social problems in the United States. According to the ""Gun Violence Archive,"" there were 52 mass shootings in January this year, making January 2023 the worst on record for the number of mass shootings since it started tracking mass shootings in 2014. Shootings occur in almost all places in people's daily lives in the United States, such as schools, subways, supermarkets, hospitals, movie theaters, bars, etc. Nowhere is immune from the possibility of a sudden eruption of gun violence.

135,"Feature: U.S. sanctions add to Afghans' pain, poverty during freezing winter","BAMYAN, Afghanistan, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) -- Living in a cave-turned shelter next to the Buddha site in central Afghanistan's Bamyan province and struggling to survive the chilly winter, Zarif blamed the tough winter life on the U.S. sanctions. Following the withdrawal of the U.S.-led forces from the Asian country, Afghanistan's assets worth more than 9 billion U.S. dollars were frozen by the United States as part of its sanctions on the new rulers of the war-torn country. ""The United States has frozen Afghanistan money. Yes, it is such sanctions that have caused price hikes and poverty. The price of seven kg of wood used to be 40 to 50 afghani, but now it is beyond the reach of ordinary people,"" said Zarif. In Afghanistan, seven kg of coal will cost 100 afghani now and the price of seven kg of wood is 90 afghani. ""The reasons for almost 90 percent of our problems are the sanctions,"" Zarif told Xinhua. Extreme chilly weather and snowfall have swept through parts of Afghanistan since the first week of January when the temperature fell to minus 30 degrees Celsius in some areas. Spokesman for the Ministry of Natural Disaster Management and Humanitarian Affairs Shafiullah Rahimi said in January that heavy snowfall and freezing weather had claimed 170 lives including women and children in the country over three weeks. Recalling his recent bitter memories, Zarif said that he, his wife and his daughter got flu, fever and respiratory diseases due to the cold weather and had to pay more than 5,000 afghani for their recovery in hospital. Like Zarif, another cave dweller Nadir Hussain has also blamed the U.S. for his suffering, saying since sanctions on Afghanistan poverty and unemployment have increased in the country. ""The U.S. sanctions have badly affected our living conditions, unemployment has increased, and the prices of everything have gone up,"" Hussain told Xinhua. Hussain, 50, seeming older than his real age, said that his wife got seasonal respiratory disease recently due to the cold weather and could hardly afford her medical treatment. Aid agencies predict that a record 28.3 million people, around two-thirds of the population, will need humanitarian assistance in 2023, with 6 million of them already perilously close to famine. In addition to the soaring prices, the sanctions have made it difficult for humanitarian aid to reach this ravaged country, since they have further worsened the already broken economy of cash-strapped Afghanistan. Martin Schüepp, director of operations of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) told Xinhua in November last year that the U.S.-initiated sanctions imposed on the Taliban-run establishment in Afghanistan have undermined vital humanitarian aid supply to the struggling country. ""When people in Bamyan are in dire need of support, the sanctions have added to the pain of people, undermined supplying humanitarian assistance,"" the director of provincial Natural Disaster Management and Humanitarian Affairs, Mawlawi Shakir Tahir said.

111,Feature: China's aid eases misery of Afghan returnees in chilly winter,"BAMYAN, Afghanistan, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) -- Abdul Azim, together with his 10 family members, huddled in a mud hut of about 50 square meters in Dara-e-Foladi, a far-flung village in the mountainous area of central Afghanistan's Bamyan province, where the temperature drops to minus 30 degrees Celsius in winter. During the 20 years of conflicts in Afghanistan after the United States invaded the country in October 2001, more than 30,000 civilians lost their lives, and some 11 million people were made refugees. To escape the war, Azim was once one of the refugees who fled from Bamiyan to Pakistan in 2005, and spent four years there begging on the streets. It was not until recent years that he settled back in his hometown. But years of displacement left his family without a fixed source of income, and extreme poverty became the next problem for Azim. Azim said there was neither water nor electricity at his home. ""The winter here is very cold and, in the past, my family had to huddle together in only one blanket to keep warm because we don't even have the fuel to make a fire to keep warm."" About 8,000 returning refugees who had fled to other countries and 500 returning families who had been displaced in other provinces are in dire need of humanitarian assistance, said Saifullah Ayar, acting director of the provincial department for refugees and repatriation affairs. To help prevent a possible humanitarian catastrophe, China pledged 250 million yuan (about 37 million U.S. dollars) in aid to Afghanistan, including food supplies and winter clothes. Late last autumn, Azim received two blankets and a coat. ""The local government called and said these were all provided by China,"" said Azim. ""When I came home with the goods from China, my children were very happy because it made our life this winter different and the children would not get cold again,"" Azim added. According to the provincial department for refugees and repatriation affairs, Chinese aid has been distributed to 844 families of returning refugees in the past one year in Bamyan. Like Azim, another returnee Taherah has thanked neighboring China for sending humanitarian aid, saying that the aid kits have helped his family to keep warm during the night. ""These are from China,"" the poverty-stricken Afghan woman said while gesturing at two blankets and a coat. Because of the impact of the war, Taherah, with three of her children, had been wandering the provinces of Bamyan and neighboring Wardak for more than a decade before returning to her hometown last year. According to the Ministry for Refugees and Repatriation of the Afghan caretaker government, more than 1 million refugees have returned home since the takeover by the Taliban on Aug. 15, 2021. However, aid agencies predicted that a record 28.3 million people, around two-thirds of the population, will need humanitarian assistance in 2023, with 6 million of those already perilously close to famine. ""We have distributed China's aid to the needy families in Bamyan and I am thankful to China for sending the assistance,"" provincial director for natural disaster management and humanitarian affairs Mawlawi Shakir Tahir told Xinhua in his office recently.",Xinhua,2023-02-21 16:31
112,Examining Year One of the Ukraine crisis,"   BEIJING, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) -- It's been almost a year since Russia launched a special military operation against Ukraine, but the conflict is far from over. The Ukraine crisis began on Feb. 24, 2022, following incitement from the United States and its allies due to NATO's eastward expansion. Today, Ukrainians and Russians still grieve their beloved ones killed on the frontlines. When the conflict is piling misery on people worldwide suffering from acute food and energy crises, the West continues to fan the flames by sending more military hardware and intelligence to Ukraine.    The battlefield has been brutal and bloody. Tens of thousands of troops on both sides have been killed, and millions of others were forced to flee their homes. But the echoes of the conflict are heard far beyond Ukraine's borders. Its heavy tolls on the world manifest through a changing landscape of regional and global security, featuring food supply chain disruptions, skyrocketing energy prices and soaring inflation. After the escalation of the Ukraine crisis, the United States and its allies imposed sanctions on Russia in hopes of choking the country's energy export channels and destroying its economy. However, those sanctions have backfired, hurt U.S. allies and triggered a worldwide energy crisis. Adding to the problem were the explosions of the Nord Stream pipelines carrying gas from Russia to Europe. In a Feb. 8 article on the U.S. portal Substack, Pulitzer Prize winner Seymour Hersh said the United States partnered with Norway in a top-secret operation in June 2022 to plant remotely triggered explosives that took out three of the four Nord Stream pipelines three months later. Ukraine and Russia jointly produce around 30 percent of the world's wheat exports. Russia is also one of the world's biggest exporters of fertilizers. The impact of the conflict between the two countries on food supply chains has contributed to rising food prices, making it harder for people in lower and middle-income economies to afford to feed their families.   According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, the food price index hit 159.7 points in March last year, the highest since 1990. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in June 2022 that fertilizer prices have risen by more than 50 percent, and energy prices have risen by more than two-thirds, putting pressure on farmers across Asia, Africa and the Americas. To make things worse, the United States and its allies have sent more weapons to Ukraine. Since Feb. 24, 2022, the United States has promised nearly 30 billion U.S. dollars in military assistance to Ukraine. In late January, the United States and Germany pledged tanks to Ukraine. The Pentagon announced a new tranche of military aid for Ukraine days later, including long-range precision rockets for the first time. The United States ""is ready to fight to the last drop of Ukrainian blood, in the end, it's prepared to fight to the last drop of European blood,"" said former British MP George Galloway. ""In the past year, increasing sanctions and upgrading weapons did not calm the situation, but instead made the conflict more acute and issues more complicated, pushing the situation to a more dangerous precipice,"" said Dai Bing, China's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, stressing dialogue and negotiation are the fundamental way out to end the conflict and restore peace.    ""We lied, we cheated, we stole. We had entire training courses. It reminds you of the glory of the American experiment,"" former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, once director of the CIA, said in 2019. The intelligence field is not the only place the United States practices this ugly tradition it prides itself on. Breaking a promise made at the end of the Cold War that NATO would not expand to the east, the U.S.-led bloc has expanded eastward five times since 1999, advancing more than 1,000 km to the Russian border. Its membership has increased from 16 to 30 countries. The deep cause of the Russia-Ukraine conflict is the expansion of NATO, and ""the Russians are reacting to the West's attempt to make Ukraine a western bulwark on Russia's border,"" John Mearsheimer, political science professor at the University of Chicago, told Xinhua. The United States and its European allies want to make Ukraine a member of NATO and the West, he said. ""From the Russian point of view, this is categorically unacceptable. It represents an existential threat, and that is what has precipitated the crisis."" To secure military hegemony, successive U.S. governments have been willful in unilaterally withdrawing from international treaties concerning arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation processes, like the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and the Treaty on Open Skies. The United States has also initiated ""color revolutions"" in the post-Soviet space, including Ukraine, stirring up geopolitical tensions in Eurasia. What awaited a West-leaning Ukraine was never rapid development but industrial collapse, economic recession and brain drain. For example, the Black Sea Shipyard, a facility in Ukraine's Mykolaiv region that built all the aircraft carrying USSR and Russian ships, was declared bankrupt in 2018. ""We don't care how many Ukrainians die. How many women, children, civilians, military will die. We do not care. It's like a great football game, and we want to win,"" former U.S. senator Richard Black said last year.    The United States has not been a superpower trying to ""introduce goodness into the world. It follows its own interests,"" Michael Lueders, a well-known German writer, told Xinhua back in 2021. Lueders' finding still rings true today. The Ukraine crisis puts ordinary folks worldwide through dire straits while Uncle Sam's war business flourishes. ""Big Oil just reported its profits. Record profits. Last year, they made 200 billion dollars in the midst of a global energy crisis,"" U.S. President Joe Biden admitted in his State of the Union Address on Feb. 7. ""American gas is three to four times cheaper on the domestic market than the price at which they offer it to Europeans. These are double standards,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said in October 2022. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed that the United States became the world's largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter during the first half of 2022. Business Insider, a U.S. financial and business news website, revealed that U.S. companies make over 100 million dollars per LNG carrier bound for Europe. ExxonMobil posted a 56-billion-dollar profit for 2022, taking home around 6.3 million dollars an hour last year and setting an annual record not just for itself but for any U.S. or European oil giant.   The United States is also plundering Europe's burning house to make money. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, which includes green incentives and tax breaks for companies producing in the United States, has hurt Europe badly. As more European companies are tempted to produce in the United States, Europe's green plan has suffered significant setbacks. Meanwhile, U.S. food giants are having a rake-off from soaring food prices. Family members of Cargill, one of the largest privately held U.S. global food companies, have seen their personal fortunes grow by a fifth since the start of 2022, reaching about 5.4 billion dollars each. America's notorious military-industrial complex isn't fairing too badly either. Lockheed Martin, the world's top weapons manufacturer, saw its stock price surge by 28 percent from 354 dollars in early January 2022 to 453 dollars on March 25 last year. ""The neocons/warmongers have spent years stoking the new Cold War with Russia and have now brought us to the brink in Ukraine -- this serves their own interests and lines the pocket of the Military Industrial Complex with trillion dollars,"" former U.S. Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard said last February. European politicians are learning from their U.S. friends business lesson 101: never mix friendship and business. Ditto for developing countries. Africa ""does not want to be the breeding ground of a new Cold War,"" Senegalese President Macky Sall said in September 2022, calling for ""a de-escalation and a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine.""",Xinhua,2023-02-22 08:14
117,"Expert says U.S. involvement in Nord Stream explosions ""not impossible""","   ZAGREB, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) -- The involvement of the U.S. Navy in the September 2022 Nord Stream explosions, as alleged by a renowned U.S. journalist in a recent report, is ""not impossible"" because the United States has benefited the most from the incident, Croatian security expert Mirko Vukobratovic said in an interview with Xinhua on Tuesday. American investigative journalist Seymour Hersh has written on the U.S. portal Substack that the U.S. Navy was involved in the Nord Stream explosions.   U.S. President Joe Biden said last February that if Russian tanks and troops cross the border and enter Ukraine, ""there will be no longer Nord Stream 2."" According to Hersh, a Pulitzer Prize winner, last June, U.S. Navy divers, operating under the cover of a widely publicized mid-summer North Atlantic Treaty Organization exercise known as BALTOPS 22, planted the remotely triggered explosives that destroyed three of the four Nord Stream pipelines three months later. Vukobratovic credited Hersh's article for providing ""important, objective"" details about the Nord Stream explosions, from which the United States has benefited the most as it can sell gas to Europe at a much higher price, in addition to exerting pressure on Russia.   If the United States had evidence of any Russian involvement, Washington and the U.S. media would be ""full of accusations directed against Russia,"" Vukobratovic noted, adding that the European Union, as usual, followed in the footsteps of the United States in this case. Vukobratovic welcomed the call by the Chinese government for a thorough investigation into the Nord Stream explosions, which seriously sabotaged vital transnational infrastructure and caused severe damages. ""The Chinese position that the investigation must be objective and impartial is the only correct one. Only when it is carried out professionally can we talk about the intentions of those who caused the explosion,"" he said.",Xinhua,2023-02-22 08:19
113,Quakes leave 1.5 mln people homeless in Türkiye: UN,"   GENEVA, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations Development Program (UNDP) official on Tuesday estimated that 1.5 million people in Türkiye have been left homeless by the recent earthquakes and some 500,000 housing units in the country will have to be rebuilt. Louisa Vinton, the UNDP's Türkiye resident representative, told an online press briefing that the country's government had inspected around 70 percent of the buildings affected by the quakes. Of these, 412,000 housing units in 118,000 buildings have collapsed or need to be demolished completely.   She said that the amount of rubble that needed to be cleared was enormous, and that the UNDP was seeking to minimize the threat of hazardous waste. According to Vinton, two weeks after the first quakes, there is reason to call this the largest natural disaster in Türkiye's history. She said that the government concluded the search and rescue phase for the first quakes on Sunday, and the last survivor was pulled from the rubble almost 300 hours after the quake.   Catherine Smallwood, senior emergency officer for the World Health Organization (WHO), told Tuesday's press briefing that managing the risks of communicable diseases is now vital as several displaced people live in close quarters, sometimes with poor access to toilets and clean water. ""There is a heightened risk of respiratory illnesses, cholera, hepatitis A and measles,"" she said. In recent weeks, Türkiye's southern Kahramanmaras province has been rattled by a series of earthquakes ranging from magnitude 6.4 to 7.7. The quakes also hit parts of Syria. In total, an estimated 47,000 people have lost their lives in the two countries, according to media reports.  ",Xinhua,2023-02-22 08:27

100,Russia suspends participation in New START treaty: Putin,"   MOSCOW, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia is suspending its participation in rather than withdrawing from the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) with the United States, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on Tuesday. NATO demanded in early February that Russia ""return to the implementation"" of the New START and allow inspections of its nuclear facilities. That ""sounds like some kind of nonsense amid today's confrontation,"" Putin said in his annual address to the Federal Assembly. He pointed out the combined strike potential of NATO as Britain and France also have nuclear arsenals that pose a threat to Russia. Meanwhile, Moscow has information that ""certain figures in Washington"" are considering nuclear weapon tests to develop new types of nuclear weapons. ""In this situation, the Russian Defense Ministry and Rosatom (Russia's State Atomic Energy Corporation) must ensure readiness for testing Russian nuclear weapons. Of course, we will not be the first to do this. But if the United States conducts a test, then will we,"" Putin said.

They wished a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured. The council members called on the transitional government of Mali to swiftly investigate the attack with the support of the UN peacekeeping mission, known as MINUSMA, promote accountability by bringing the perpetrators to justice, and keep the relevant troop-contributing country informed of the progress. They underlined that attacks targeting peacekeepers may constitute war crimes under international law. They stressed that involvement in planning, directing, sponsoring or conducting attacks against MINUSMA peacekeepers constitutes a basis for sanctions designations pursuant to Security Council resolutions. The council members underscored that the primary responsibility of the safety and security of UN personnel and assets rests with host states, and highlighted the importance of engagement and communications between MINUSMA and the transitional government of Mali. They reaffirmed that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security, and stressed the need for all states to combat by all means threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts.

On Monday night, two new earthquakes measuring 6.4- and 5.8-magnitude, respectively, jolted the southern Hatay province near the Syrian border, killing at least six people and wounding 294 others. Many buildings weakened by the Feb. 6 tremors collapsed during the latest earthquakes. Many residents of Hatay, whose homes had been damaged or destroyed, flocked to the intercity bus terminal in order to leave the province, the NTV broadcaster reported on Tuesday. Images from the local DHA news agency showed some sections of highways in Hatay collapsed, with meters-long crevices. Patients in an intensive care unit were transported to field hospitals to continue their treatment after two hospitals in the districts of Antakya and Iskenderun were evacuated. The massive earthquakes have not only affected the lives of local Turkish citizens, but also those of tens of thousands of Syrian refugees being accommodated in the area. Over 20,000 Syrians in Türkiye voluntarily returned to their home country after recent quakes, Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said on Tuesday.

106,Ohio train derailment reveals need for urgent reform: The Guardian,"LONDON, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States railroad unions say rail companies' desire for increased profits is driving up safety risks -- and more accidents will happen without action, The Guardian said on Monday. They said that the train derailment in Ohio, which forced thousands of residents to evacuate and is now spreading a noxious plume of carcinogenic chemicals across the area, should be an ""eye-opening"" revelation for Congress and ""an illustration of how the railroads operate, and how they're getting away with a lot of things,"" the report said. Workers and union officials cited the Norfolk Southern Railway derailment in early February as a glaring example of why safety reforms to the industry -- which include providing workers with paid sick leave -- need to be made, it said. Unions and rail companies have been at loggerheads for years over new contracts that would address what workers describe as poor working conditions, and would provide paid sick days amid grueling schedules caused by labor cuts, it said. ""Without a change in the working conditions, without better scheduling, without more time off, without a better work-life balance, the railroad is going to suffer,"" said Ron Kaminkow, general secretary of Railroad Workers United.

105,Russia-Ukraine conflict cost world economy 1.6 trln USD in 2022: study,"BERLIN, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) -- Without the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the global economy would have generated an additional 1.6 trillion U.S. dollars in 2022, according to a study published by the German Economic Institute (IW) on Tuesday. The conflict has a ""high global economic significance,"" IW expert Michael Groemling said in a statement. Above all, energy and raw material supply problems were putting pressure on companies worldwide. Western economies were particularly affected as they lost two-thirds of their global production, according to the study. In Germany, Europe's largest economy, soaring energy prices pushed inflation temporarily above the 10 percent mark in 2022 before relief measures brought prices down again. In January, inflation stabilized at 8.7 percent, according to provisional data published by the Federal Statistical Office. ""High energy prices caused cost shocks at the production level, which became a burden difficult to calculate for many companies,"" the IW said. The resulting rise in consumer prices ""eroded the purchasing power of households, which cut back their consumption,"" the institute noted. Finally, companies were reluctant to invest due to the global uncertainty and higher prices. For 2023, the IW projects an additional global value-added loss of 1 trillion U.S. dollars.

107,"EU, NATO, Ukraine to ramp up arms production, procurement","BRUSSELS, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine, the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will jointly launch a mechanism to coordinate arms supplies to Ukraine, officials said here after the first meeting of the three sides' high-level representatives. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he discussed with Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell the need to ramp up weapons production and improve arms procurement ""to ensure that Ukraine gets the weapons it needs."" ""We are looking for ways to accelerate the deliveries from member states to Ukraine,"" Borrell said. To this end, the three sides will set up a coordination mechanism that will link their defense industries, procurers and governments. This will allow them to not only meet Ukraine's needs on the frontline but also to replenish the NATO and EU member states' ammunition stockpiles. Since the consumption rate of ammunition is greater than the production rate, the EU and NATO member states need to ramp up production, Stoltenberg and Borrell said. Efforts to ramp up production started at the end of last summer, according to Kuleba. NATO will help Ukraine develop a procurement system that is effective, transparent and accountable, Stoltenberg said. The alliance will also increase its targets for ammunition stockpiles through its Defense Planning Process. Stoltenberg said he regretted Russia's decision to suspend its participation in the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) with the United States, which was announced earlier on Tuesday by Russia's President Vladimir Putin. Russia suspends participation in New START rather than withdraws from it, Putin said. In early February, NATO called on Russia to ""return to full compliance"" with New START and allow inspections of its nuclear facilities. That ""sounds like some kind of nonsense amid today's confrontation,"" Putin said in his annual address to Russia's Federal Assembly. He pointed to the combined strike potential of NATO as the United Kingdom and France also have nuclear arsenals that pose a threat to Russia. Moscow said it had information that ""certain figures in Washington"" are considering conducting tests to develop new types of nuclear weapons.",Xinhua,2023-02-22 10:24

110,U.S. sees worst weekend of 2023 over gun violence: USA Today,"NEW YORK, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) -- There were 10 mass shootings from Feb. 17 through Feb. 19, the most of any weekend so far this year in the United States, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive. That's considering all shootings from Friday to Sunday in which four or more people were shot, not including the shooter or shooters, reported USA Today on Monday. The number of shootings over the weekend is unusual for mid-February in the country, which came on the heels of several high-profile mass shootings in California last month, as well as an attack at Michigan State University last week. Mark Bryant, executive director of the Gun Violence Archive, said 10 mass shootings in a single weekend is ""certainly high for this time of year."" Research suggests gun violence in the United States typically increases during the warmer months. Mass shootings in 2022 reached their peak in mid-July, when the United States witnessed 15 mass shootings over a regular weekend, according to Gun Violence Archive data.

115,U.S. Supreme Court decision sows confusion over firearm restrictions: AP,"NEW YORK, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) -- A landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision on the Second Amendment is upending gun laws across the country, dividing judges and sowing confusion over what firearm restrictions can remain on the books, reported The Associated Press (AP) on Saturday. The high court's ruling that set new standards for evaluating gun laws left open many questions, experts say, resulting in an increasing number of conflicting decisions as lower court judges struggle to figure out how to apply it, according to the report. The Supreme Court's so-called Bruen decision changed the test that lower courts had long used for evaluating challenges to firearm restrictions. Judges should no longer consider whether the law serves public interests like enhancing public safety, the justices said. Under the Supreme Court's new test, the government that wants to uphold a gun restriction must look back into history to show it is consistent with the country's ""historical tradition of firearm regulation."" In several instances, judges looking at the same laws have come down on opposite sides on whether they are constitutional in the wake of the conservative Supreme Court majority's ruling, said the report. ""The legal turmoil caused by the first major gun ruling in a decade will likely force the Supreme Court to step in again soon to provide more guidance for judges,"" it added.",Xinhua,2023-02-22 10:34

84,"U.S. tax law likely to cause economic disparities between African Americans, Whites: CNN","WASHINGTON, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) -- Though the U.S. tax code contains no provision targeting a racial group, the law can actually cause or increase economic disparities between African American households and Whites, CNN reported Monday, citing a recent study. Research by the Washington D.C.-based Tax Policy Center showed African American couples, on average, face higher tax costs associated with marriage than White people. ""We find that Black couples are more likely than White couples to experience an income tax penalty from marriage and to face higher penalties. We show that these patterns arise because, controlling for income, Black spouses have more equal earning that white spouses ... and because Black couples are more likely to have dependents,"" researchers said. The finding, as part of a growing body of research, provides proof of ""the likelihood of racial inequities in the tax code,"" according to CNN.",Xinhua,2023-02-22 10:40
86,"Investigative journalist terms Nord Stream bombing ""dumbest"" act from Washington: Indian media","NEW DELHI, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) -- American investigative journalist Seymour Hersh has termed the Nord Stream bombing, which he says was done by the United States, the ""dumbest"" act from Washington in years, an Indian news website Firstpost reported. Hersh reported that the United States planted the bombs on the Nord Stream pipeline under the Baltic sea, which carried Russian gas to Germany, during the Baltops joint military drill in June last year, and the Nord Stream pipeline was blown apart in a series of explosions in August, the news website said. ""I think the consequences politically for us (the United States) are enormous,"" Hersh was quoted in an interview as saying. He said the long-term effect of the sabotage would be ""horrific"" for Europe, adding that the act ""cut into the notion that they can depend totally on America, even in a crisis,"" the website said. Hersh noted that the United States always wanted to isolate Russia to prevent it from selling oil and gas to the European Union. According to the website, Hersh feels that the United States saw energy alternatives for Europe as a ""threat,"" and the Biden administration feared that Europe would ""walk away"" from the Ukrainian crisis if it felt the need for Russian fuel carried by the pipeline, which was under sanctions. ""The fear of losing European support in the Ukraine conflict made the U.S. to take out the only option Europe had should it want to restart buying fuel from Russia,"" Hersh argued. The White House has denied Hersh's claim as ""complete nonsense"" but Hersh said that his information was accurate, said the website. The American journalist slammed the U.S. mainstream media for looking the other way on his expose. Hersh singled out the New York Times and Washington Post for refusing to ""run a word"" on the story and ignoring calls for an international investigation into the Nord Stream blasts, said the website. He said that he would carry on his expose on how the United States blew up the fuel lines without considering the adverse effect it would have on Europe in the winters, the website said.",Xinhua,2023-02-22 10:56

92,Europe pays high price for Russia-Ukraine conflict,"PARIS, Feb. 22 (Xinhua) -- One year into the Russia-Ukraine conflict, France and the rest of Europe are finding themselves in a delicate position, teetering under the impact of inflation, an energy crisis, and slowing economic growth.  The Russian-Ukrainian conflict has pushed up inflation in France. Price hikes have reached record level in the country since February last year. Data from the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) show that France's annual inflation rate stood at 5.2 percent for 2022, after 1.6 percent in 2021 and 0.5 percent in 2020. Energy prices alone have increased by 23.1 percent yearly, followed by 6.8 percent for food and 3 percent for manufactured goods and services. Energy prices in the country reached record high in 2022, with natural gas traded at 340 euros (364 U.S. dollars) per megawatt-hour (MWh) on Aug. 26 last year, against under 30 euros (32 dollars) per MWh at the same time in 2021. Faced with soaring energy prices, the tariff shield introduced in 2021 by the French government has been extended, particularly for small businesses. An Energy Sobriety Plan was officially unveiled on Oct. 6, 2022, aiming to reduce the country's overall energy consumption by 10 percent within the next two years and by 40 percent by 2050. France's energy sobriety plan will cost 800 million euros (785 million dollars) to the country, Minister for Energy Transition Agnes Pannier-Runacher said. Public lighting in the streets are on for less time and less intensively, companies must commit to switching off the lights in unoccupied buildings, and working from home is encouraged in public administrations. The plan also requires that heating should be lowered in offices, swimming pools and gyms, and the use of hot water must be reduced in offices.  Baguette, essential for the French, is an indicator of the cost of living in France. In 2022, its price surged several times, passing the threshold of 1 euro (1.07 dollars) per baguette in many bakeries. At the same time, the price of wheat fluctuated from 180 euros (193 dollars) to 460 euros (492 dollars) per tonne at the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, to stabilize at around 360 euros (385 dollars) per tonne. This surge in prices has directly affected consumers' wallets. ""Before, I didn't pay much attention to the prices when I was shopping, but with inflation, I watch more carefully,"" a woman named Helene told Xinhua. Many French people have chosen to lower the temperature of their houses to reduce expenditure. Daphnee, who lives in an old house covering an area of 130 square meters, has drastically lowered the temperature at her house in fear of a high energy bill. ""I feel cold, so it was a sacrifice, but in the end, I realized that we were fine at home with 18 degrees Celsius, all you need is a hot water bottle for the night,"" she said. French companies are also hit hard by the soaring energy prices. Last October, over 300 companies alerted the French government to the negative effect of the surging energy prices. More than one out of two French industrial companies said they had suffered consequences from the energy crisis and their production bottlenecks had affected business profitability. A survey conducted in October last year showed that 80 percent of the country's small and medium-sized enterprises worry about their survival. And the trend continues. According to a study on corporate insolvencies, the rebound in bankruptcies that began in 2022 is not over and companies face a triple threat of weaker growth, reduced margins and deteriorating financing conditions in 2023.  The European Commission forecasted that the French economy would grow by 0.6 percent and 1.4 percent respectively for 2023 and 2024, and the German economy would grow even lower, by 0.2 percent and 1.3 percent respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2022, six of eurozone countries showed negative economic growth, including Germany and Italy, whose growth declined by 0.2 percent and 0.1 percent respectively. The two countries were hardest hit by the Ukraine crisis, as both have export-driven economies and depend heavily on natural gas from Russia, which has been disrupted following sanctions against Russia. With access to Russian gas becoming increasingly difficult as a result of the crisis, European countries had to switch to much expensive American liquefied natural gas (LNG). However, the United States sells its LNG to Europe at ""four times"" the price at which it sells to American suppliers, said French Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire last year, who feared that the United States could benefit from the situation to the detriment of European interests. He insisted on the need to build ""economic relations that are more balanced on the energy issue between our American allies and the European continent."" Le Maire's remarks came just days after French President Emmanuel Macron expressed his dissatisfaction over LNG imported from the United States and Norway. ""We are going to say with great friendship towards our American friends, our Norwegian friends, that 'you are great, you provide us with gas.' But there is one thing that can't work for a very long time, that is we can't pay for gas that is four times more expensive,"" he said. According to data and analytics firm Kpler, the EU imported a total of 94.73 million tonnes of LNG in 2022, and the United States accounts for roughly 41 percent of the imports, becoming the EU's top LNG supplier. Besides, the consequences of the Inflation Reduction Act, a massive U.S. plan of 369 billion dollars of industrial subsidies announced in the summer of 2022, poses a new trade threat for Europe.",Xinhua,2023-02-22 13:23
88,"Iran slaps ""retaliatory"" sanctions on EU, British individuals, entities","TEHRAN, Feb. 22 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian Foreign Ministry imposed Tuesday new sanctions on several individuals and entities of the European Union and Britain for ""supporting terrorism and inciting violence."" The ""retaliatory"" move targets those supporting terrorism and terrorist groups, encouraging terrorist acts and violence against Iranians, interfering in Iran's domestic affairs, spreading false information about Iran and escalating ""economic terrorism"" against the country, the ministry said in a statement. The sanctions, covering 13 entities and 15 individuals from the EU and eight British individuals, include blocking accounts and transactions under the Iranian financial and banking systems, freezing their assets inside Iran, and prohibiting their visa issuance and entry into Iran's territory, it said.

91,"U.S. hegemonic, domineering, bullying practices exerting grave harm","As the world's most powerful country, the United States has long been pursuing, maintaining and abusing hegemony under the guise of promoting ""democracy,"" ""freedom,"" ""human rights"" and upholding a ""rule-based international order."" Clinging to the Cold-War mentality, the country has ramped up bloc politics, provoked conflict and confrontation, arbitrarily imposed unilateral sanctions, grossly interfered in other countries' internal affairs, advanced in infiltration and subversion and willfully waged wars. The notorious record of the U.S. in the political, military, economic, financial, technological and cultural fields, seriously threatens world peace and stability, and the well-being of all peoples. Recently, the indifference of U.S. hegemony was once again exposed as Syrian people, who have been severely impacted by deadly earthquakes, failed to receive timely assistance due to U.S. sanctions. To maintain its hegemony, the U.S. has long been attempting to mold other countries with its own values and political system. In the name of ""promoting democracy,"" it has pushed for the ""Neo-Monroe Doctrine"" in Latin America, instigated ""color revolutions"" in Eurasia, and orchestrated the ""Arab Spring"" in West Asia and North Africa, bringing chaos and disaster to many countries. Over the recent years, it fabricated a false narrative of ""democracy versus authoritarianism,"" assembled a so-called ""value alliance,"" and formed exclusive clubs. Such hegemonic practices have created division in regions, stoked confrontation and undermined peace. The high military spending for long and wanton use of force have indicated the U.S. military hegemony. The U.S. has about 800 overseas military bases, with 173,000 troops deployed in 159 countries. According to a Tufts University report, the U.S. undertook nearly 400 military interventions globally between 1776 and 2019. The U.S. military hegemony has led to humanitarian tragedies around the world. The wars and military operations launched by the country in the name of fighting terrorism have claimed over 900,000 lives. The U.S. has created 37 million refugees around the world. More than 10 million Afghans were displaced. It has also left Libya in incessant civil unrest. Looting and exploitation with its economic hegemony is a customary trick of the U.S. By taking advantage of the dollar's status as the major international reserve currency, it is basically collecting ""seigniorage"" from around the world. It costs only about 17 cents to produce a 100-dollar bill, but other countries had to pony up 100 dollars of actual goods or services in order to obtain one. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. abused its global financial hegemony and injected trillions of dollars into the global market, leaving other countries, especially emerging economies, to pay the price. With its control over international economic and financial organizations, the U.S. imposes additional conditions to their assistance to other countries. In order to reduce obstacles to U.S. capital inflow and speculation, the recipient countries are required to make their economic policies fall in line with America's strategy. The United States also suppresses its opponents with economic coercion, doubling down on unilateral sanctions and ""long-arm jurisdiction."" So far, the U.S. had or has imposed economic sanctions on nearly 40 countries across the world, affecting nearly half of the world's population. Its economic and financial hegemony has completely become a geopolitical weapon. The U.S. seeks to deter other countries' scientific, technological and economic development by wielding monopoly power, suppression measures and technology restrictions in high-tech fields. It monopolizes intellectual property in the name of protection. Overstretching the concept of national security, the U.S. mobilized state power to suppress and sanction enterprises of other countries. It weaponizes technological issues and uses them as ideological tools. The U.S. has put ""democracy"" and ""human rights"" labels on high-technology, so as to fabricate excuses for its technological blockade against other countries. Besides, it also abuses its technological hegemony by carrying out cyber attacks and eavesdropping. The U.S. worships hegemonic, domineering and bullying practices, and has long left behind fair competition and win-win cooperation. Just as French entrepreneur Marc Lassus said in his book The Chip Trap, the U.S. values of the so-called ""free market"" and ""full competition"" are pure hypocrisy. The U.S. has often used cultural tools to strengthen and maintain its hegemony in the world. William Blum, an American expert on U.S. foreign policy, once described ideology as a major force fueling the U.S. ambitions to rule the world. American values and lifestyle are a tied product to its movies and TV shows, publications, media content, and programs. The country thus shapes a cultural and public opinion space in which American culture reigns and maintains cultural hegemony. It also pours staggering amounts of public funds into radio and TV networks to support their ideological infiltration. U.S.-dominated Western media has a particularly important role in shaping global public opinion. The U.S. uses misinformation as a spear to attack other countries, and has built an industrial chain around it: there are groups and individuals making up stories, and peddling them worldwide to mislead public opinion with the support of nearly limitless financial resources. While a just cause wins its champion wide support, an unjust one condemns its pursuer to be an outcast. The hegemonic, domineering, and bullying practices of using strength to intimidate the weak, taking from others by force and subterfuge, and playing zero-sum games are exerting grave harm. Such practices have drawn growing, intense criticism and opposition from the international community. The country must critically examine what it has done, let go of its arrogance and prejudice, and quit its hegemonic, domineering and bullying practices. ",People's Daily,2023-02-22 15:41
77,Calls mount for probe into alleged U.S. involvement in Nord Stream blasts,"   ROME, Feb. 22 (Xinhua) -- Three European countries looking into the details surrounding last September's Nord Stream pipelines explosion said on Tuesday they are not sure when their probes will be complete, even as allegations swirl that the United States may have been responsible for the underwater blast. A leading European analyst told Xinhua on Tuesday potential proof of U.S. involvement would impact the way each side of the Ukraine crisis is viewed internationally. Davide Tabarelli, a professor of industrial engineering at the University of Bologna and president of Nomisma Energia, an energy research consultancy, said rumors of possible U.S. sabotage were out even earlier than the latest debate. ""We have heard rumors of a possible involvement by the United States for several weeks, well before the latest accusations,"" Tabarelli told Xinhua.   The Nord Stream pipelines, which transported natural gas from Russia to European markets via Germany, were severely damaged last September after blasts in the Baltic Sea. One pipeline, Nord Stream 1, was in operation at the time of the explosion and Nord Stream 2, though had not been operational, was filled with gas. Recent allegations from Pulitzer Prize-winning U.S. journalist Seymour Hersh and others said that the attack had been carried out by divers from the U.S. Navy. Hersh, who has pledged to share more information from his investigation soon, said explosives were planted during exercises involving countries allied within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) around three months prior to the blast and only detonated in September.   U.S. National Security Council Spokesman John Kirby on Monday dismissed allegations of U.S. involvement in the explosions. Russia requested that the United Nations (UN) Security Council call for an international investigation into the explosion. On Tuesday, the Security Council heatedly debated Russia's request for a UN-led inquiry into the incident. An investigation by the UN Security Council into the explosions that blew up the Nord Stream natural gas pipelines in September 2022 is a high global priority, said Jeffrey Sachs, a world-renowned economist, on Tuesday. ""The destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines on Sept. 26, 2022, constitutes an act of international terrorism and represents a threat to the peace,"" Sachs told the Security Council in a briefing.   China supports speeding up the investigation into the Nord Stream explosions so as to swiftly find out the truth, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Wednesday. Noting the Nord Stream gas pipelines are major transboundary infrastructure and energy transportation arteries, Wang said the explosions had a major negative impact on the global energy market and the ecological environment. In a joint letter to the Security Council, Denmark, Sweden and Germany -- the three countries closest geographically to the part of the Baltic Sea where the explosions took place -- said that their investigations were ongoing and that it was unclear when they would conclude. Noting the ""consequences as concerns greenhouse gas emissions are substantial and worrisome,"" the letter reiterated that ""deliberate acts, such as those committed against the Nord Stream pipelines, are unacceptable, endanger international security and give cause for our deep concern.""   Croatian security expert Mirko Vukobratovic told Xinhua on Tuesday that the alleged involvement of the U.S. Navy in the September 2022 Nord Stream explosions, is ""not impossible"" because the United States has benefited the most from the incident.",Xinhua,2023-02-23 08:34

78,New NATO talks with Türkiye to resume in mid-March: Swedish PM,"STOCKHOLM, Feb. 22 (Xinhua) -- Talks between Sweden, Finland and Türkiye would resume in mid-March, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson told local media Wednesday night. ""We have just confirmed this today,"" Kristersson told Swedish public television broadcaster SVT, without specifying the date for such talks. Türkiye has postponed a trilateral meeting with Sweden and Finland on their North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) bids slated for February following the burning of a copy of the Quran in Stockholm. Despite the U.S. attempts to push for both countries' rapid accession into NATO, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu on Monday reaffirmed Ankara's demand for more efforts from Sweden over its security concerns. Ankara's stance on Finland's accession could be different and its membership could be ratified earlier, he said. Finland and Sweden applied to join NATO in May 2022 in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Their accession needs the approval of all member states of the military alliance. Türkiye and Hungary, both members of NATO, have yet to give their approvals. Türkiye requests that the two Nordic countries to ""speedily and thoroughly"" extradite individuals it considers to be terrorist suspects.",Xinhua,2023-02-23 08:57
79,Ukraine conflict pushes cost of living in Spain further,"MADRID, Feb. 22 (Xinhua) -- Just like the rest of Europe, Spain is still suffering from rising food and fuel prices on the first anniversary of the Ukraine conflict. The conflict affects the budgets of households throughout the country, despite the government's attempts to keep prices as low as possible. According to the Spanish Statistical Office (INE), prices rose by 8.4 percent in the country in 2022, peaking at 10.8 in July, almost three percentage points more than in February 2022, when the conflict broke out. The price rises were mainly caused by the energy supply problems across Europe, which at the time was highly dependent on Russian gas and petroleum. Spain and Portugal were able to negotiate the ""Iberian exception"" with the other member states of the European Union (EU), which protected them from the adverse effects of the rising gas prices as a relatively high proportion of their energy comes from renewable sources. The cost of electricity in Spain still exceeded 200 euros (212 U.S. dollars) per megawatt-hour (MWh) in the middle of 2022, which pushed up household energy bills and production costs. The price hikes were eventually passed on to consumers. Inflation in 2022 was 8.4 percent. Food and non-alcoholic drinks prices increased by 15.4 percent between January 2022 and January 2023, according to the INE. Sugar became 52.1 percent more expensive, milk, butter and cooking oils cost over 30 percent more, and the prices of eggs, yogurt, flour and cheese increased by more than 20 percent. At the start of 2023, the Spanish government scrapped value-added tax (VAT) on essential foods for six months and lowered it from 10 percent to 5 percent on pasta and olive oil. The price of diesel and petroleum also rose sharply in 2022, with the former going up by 28.5 percent and the latter by 14.9 percent, according to the EU's Oil Bulletin. The sharpest price increases of 45.6 percent and 33.6 percent, respectively, came in March, shortly after the start of the Ukraine conflict. Rising fuel costs prompted a 20-day strike by independent transport workers, which further increased the country's supply problems and put an extra strain on the households' budgets.",Xinhua,2023-02-23 08:58
82,"Türkiye launches salary support scheme, bans layoffs in earthquake zone","ANKARA, Feb. 22 (Xinhua) -- Türkiye has launched a temporary salary support scheme and banned job cuts in southern provinces hit by the recent earthquakes, the country's official gazette said Wednesday. The government will provide salary support for employers in provinces under the state of emergency to partially cover the wages of their workers. Employers will be able to benefit from the allowance if their workplaces are ""heavily or moderately damaged."" In addition, the government also banned layoffs in the earthquake zone, except for reasons of not complying with the rules of morality and goodwill, closure of the workplace, and expiry of the employment contract, said the report. The move aims to safeguard workers and businesses in the region from the economic impact of the devastating earthquakes on Feb. 6, which have claimed over 42,000 lives. The earthquakes could cost up to 84 billion U.S. dollars, or about 10 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP), according to a report from the Turkish Enterprise and Business Confederation (TURKONFED). A total of 70.7 billion dollars of financial damage will result from housing loss, 10.4 billion dollars from national income loss and 2.9 billion dollars from loss of working days, the TURKONFED said in its preliminary report issued four days after the quakes. The 10 quake-hit provinces, where some 13.5 million people lived, account for 9.3 percent of the country's GDP and 8.7 percent of Türkiye's total exports, with cereals, pulses, oil seeds and their products, steel, agricultural products, textiles and raw materials, and ready-made clothing products as the leading export items from the region. However, given a mass exodus from the disaster region, it is unlikely for the factories in the region to find enough workers even if they are able to resume production. In the southern province of Mersin that neighbors the disaster-affected region, 47 institutions and non-governmental organizations made a joint statement on Wednesday, saying the population of the province increased by 40 percent in two weeks because of migration after the earthquake. ""There are 70,000 families coming from the quake region, and an estimated 40,000 will stay here,"" Vahap Secer, mayor of Mersin Metropolitan Municipality, said in a statement, calling for housing projects in his province too. Turks have already been struggling for several years with rampant inflation and currency turmoil. The massive earthquakes hitting the country on Feb. 6 have further added to their woes.",Xinhua,2023-02-23 09:08
81,Japan says U.S. mistakenly issues G7 statement on Russia,"TOKYO, Feb. 22 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese foreign ministry on Wednesday denied a Group of Seven (G7) foreign ministers' joint statement condemning Russia issued by the U.S. State Department, local media reported. Japan did not issue such a statement and the ministry has communicated the apparent error to the U.S. State Department, said the ministry. According to the ministry, the U.S. State Department mistakenly sent a G7 foreign ministers' statement, presumably from October 2022, to the press. Multiple local media, including Kyodo News, retracted articles based on the erroneous statement on Wednesday evening. Japan is the rotating chair of G7 this year and the G7 summit will be held in Hiroshima in May.",Xinhua,2023-02-23 09:11
98,Japan covets G7 endorsement on radioactive water discharge,"TOKYO, Feb. 22 (Xinhua) -- Japan will seek the endorsement of the Group of Seven (G7) nations for its latest radioactive wastewater discharge plan when it hosts a meeting of the group's energy ministers in April, local media reported Wednesday. The government is seeking to include a phrase that says the G7 members ""welcome"" its ""transparent"" approach toward the disposal of the treated water in a document to be released after the April 15-16 gathering in Sapporo, Kyodo News reported citing government sources. The move reflects the government's attempts to promote a narrative about the safety of the treated water, which contains low-level concentrations of tritium, according to the reports. In January, the Japanese government said a controversial plan to release radioactive wastewater from the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan's northeast into the Pacific Ocean will start in the spring or summer. The announcement came before the visit of a technical task force of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Japan from Jan. 16 to Jan. 20 to review the country's plan, following which a report will be published within three months. Amid angry backlash among the Japanese public and local fishing communities, neighboring countries China and South Korea as well as Pacific island nations have expressed opposition.",Xinhua,2023-02-23 09:47
83,NATO urged to quit groundless smears against China on Ukraine issue,"BEIJING, Feb. 22 (Xinhua) -- China on Wednesday urged NATO to quit groundless speculation and smears against it on the Ukraine issue, grow out of the Cold War mentality of zero-sum game and bloc confrontation, and actually do something conducive to European and global peace and stability. Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin made the comment in response to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg's recent remarks that NATO members ""are also increasingly concerned that China may be planning to provide lethal support for Russia's war."" Wang said on the Ukraine issue, China always stands on the side of peace. China has taken an objective and just position, and worked actively to promote peace talks. It is a known fact that NATO countries including the United States are the biggest source of weaponry for the battlefield in Ukraine, yet they keep claiming that China may be supplying weapons to Russia. This is a familiar trick used and exposed soon after the Ukraine crisis broke out, Wang noted. Wang said while claiming itself to be a regional defensive alliance, NATO has ignored others' security concerns, and constantly sought to reach beyond its traditional defense zone and scope, and stoke division and tension. ""What role has NATO played in the Ukraine crisis? The rest of the world surely has its answer."" ""We urge NATO to quit groundless speculation and smears against China on the Ukraine issue, grow out of the Cold War mentality of zero-sum game and bloc confrontation, stop instigating antagonism and fanning the flames, and actually do something conducive to European and global peace and stability,"" he said.",Xinhua,2023-02-23 09:49
89,U.S. railroad ordered to clean up Ohio train wreck as White House takes more heat,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ordered Norfolk Southern on Tuesday to ""conduct all necessary actions associated with the cleanup"" from the train that derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, over two weeks ago. The federal agency said the legally binding order would require Norfolk Southern to identify and clean up contaminated soil and water resources; attend and participate in public meetings at the EPA's request and post information online; and pay for the agency's costs for work performed under this order, among other things. The EPA warned that if Norfolk Southern fails to comply, the agency will perform the work itself and seek triple damages from the company. ""The Norfolk Southern train derailment has upended the lives of East Palestine families, and EPA's order will ensure the company is held accountable for jeopardizing the health and safety of this community,"" EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement. ""Let me be clear: Norfolk Southern will pay for cleaning up the mess they created and for the trauma they've inflicted on this community,"" Regan continued. The EPA said the order marks the transition of the multi-agency response from its ""emergency"" phase to a longer-term remediation phase. A Norfolk Southern train carrying hazardous materials, including vinyl chloride, derailed in East Palestine, an Ohio village on the state's border with Pennsylvania, on the night of Feb. 3. According to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, 38 rail cars derailed, and an additional 12 cars were damaged by fire. There were no reported fatalities or injuries. Fear of a possible explosion prompted hundreds of residents to evacuate from a so-called controlled release and burning of chemicals on Feb. 6, which discharged toxic and potentially deadly fumes into the air. While residents have been able to return to their homes in East Palestine, they have reported incidents like burning eyes, ill pets or dead fish in waterways. The EPA said on Tuesday that it had assisted with indoor air monitoring of more than 550 homes under a voluntary screening program offered to residents. No vinyl chloride or hydrogen chloride detections were identified above levels of concern. East Palestine mayor Trent Conaway said on Monday that U.S. President Joe Biden's visit to Ukraine on America's Presidents' Day was the ""biggest slap in the face"" as his town continues to deal with the fallout of the train derailment. ""He doesn't care about us,"" Conaway said during an appearance on Fox News. ""He can send every agency he wants to, but I found out this morning that he was in Ukraine giving millions of dollars away to people over there and not to us on Presidents' Day in our country. So I'm furious."" Biden made a surprise visit to the Ukrainian capital of Kiev on Monday, days before the first anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, where he announced an additional 500 million U.S. dollars in aid, including more weapons, to the country. On Monday afternoon, Ohio suffered another major safety incident after an explosion at a metal manufacturing plant in Bedford killed one person and injured 13 others. ""What in the world is Pres. Biden doing in Kyiv, rather than minding his own business in Ohio?"" Steve Hanke, professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, tweeted. The United States needs ""a government who will fight for the people and the people of its own country,"" Eric Reeves, a protester from Texas, said. ""If you look at our cities in America, if you look at (what) America is in, we could be using all of that money, all of that effort here in America to help the people of America to do better.""",Xinhua,2023-02-23 09:55

93,India's Jharkhand state on bird flu alert,"NEW DELHI, Feb. 22 (Xinhua) -- Authorities in the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand on Wednesday issued an alert following the outbreak of bird flu in one of the government-run poultry farms. The bird flu outbreak has been confirmed at a government-run poultry farm in Lohanchal of Bokaro district, which is about 120 km northeast of Ranchi, the capital city of Jharkhand. According to officials, around 700 to 800 chickens have died over the past week due to the outbreak at the farm. ""Following the confirmation about the bird flu in Bokaro, instructions have been issued to set up control rooms in all 24 districts to monitor the situation,"" an official of the state animal husbandry department said. ""The top officials have also met to discuss the issue and decided to cull the remaining birds at the affected poultry farm to contain the spread of the disease."" The local animal husbandry department has immediately put into place prescribed standard operating procedures (SOPs) after confirmation of avian influenza (H5N1) in the samples sent from the poultry farm to the Bhopal-based National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAN). Based on the SOPs, the area within one km radius of the affected poultry farm was declared as an affected zone, and areas within 10 km radius were earmarked as the surveillance zone. The animal husbandry department has formed teams that will be conducting random sampling within a 10-km radius in Bokaro to check the possible spread. As per officials, the sale of poultry birds will be banned in these areas until further orders. The local administration has urged people to refrain from consuming poultry birds until the situation improves. Bird flu is a highly infectious and severe respiratory disease in birds caused by the H5N1 influenza virus, which can occasionally infect humans as well.",Xinhua,2023-02-23 10:22
95,"U.S. agency releases report on Ohio train derailment but questions, concerns linger","   WASHINGTON, Feb. 23 (Xinhua) -- A federal agency released a preliminary report Thursday on the derailment of a train carrying hazardous chemicals in East Palestine, Ohio, earlier this month. The report issued by the National Transportation Security Board (NTSB) said the Norfolk Southern train passed three hot bearing detectors (HBD) on its trip before the derailment on the night of Feb. 3. The function of the HBD is to detect overheated bearings and provide audible real-time warnings to train crews. One of the HBDs ""transmitted a critical audible alarm message instructing the crew to slow and stop the train to inspect a hot axle,"" according to the report. After hearing the warning, the train engineer ""increased the dynamic brake application to further slow and stop the train"" and the crew later observed fire and smoke and notified the dispatcher of a possible derailment. The derailed equipment included 11 tank cars carrying hazardous materials that subsequently ignited, fueling fires that damaged an additional 12 non-derailed railcars. First responders implemented a one-mile evacuation zone surrounding the derailment site that affected up to 2,000 residents. There were no reported fatalities or injuries. Responders mitigated the fire on Feb. 5, the NTSB report stated. But five derailed ""specification tank cars carrying 115,580 gallons of vinyl chloride"" continued to concern authorities because the temperature inside one tank car was still rising. This increase in temperature suggested that the vinyl chloride was undergoing a polymerization reaction, which could pose an explosion hazard.   Vinyl chloride is a colorless gas that burns easily. It does not occur naturally and must be produced industrially for its commercial uses. Vinyl chloride exposure is associated with an increased risk of a rare form of liver cancer as well as primary liver cancer, brain and lung cancers, lymphoma, and leukemia. The NTSB said on Thursday that responders scheduled a ""controlled venting"" of the five vinyl chloride tank cars to release and burn the vinyl chloride and dug ditches to contain released vinyl chloride liquid while it vaporized and burned. The controlled venting began on Feb. 6, which discharged toxic and potentially deadly fumes into the air. While residents were allowed to return to their homes in East Palestine two days later, they remain concerned about the handling of the incident as well as the health impact of exposure to those chemicals. The hazardous material tank cars have been decontaminated, the NTSB said. The agency's investigators returned to Ohio earlier this week to ""examine each hazardous material tank car, document damage, and secure evidence for laboratory analysis."" The NTSB added that the investigation is ongoing and will focus on the wheelset and bearing; tank car design and derailment damage; a review of the accident response, including the venting and burning of the vinyl chloride; and railcar design and maintenance procedures and practices, among other things.   U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg visited East Palestine on Thursday morning amid criticism that the response from the federal government to the incident has been slow and inadequate. ""This morning I'm in East Palestine, Ohio, to see the site of the Norfolk Southern derailment, hear updates from investigators, and meet first responders,"" Buttigieg tweeted. Buttigieg's trip to East Palestine, a village in northeastern Columbiana County, Ohio, came a day after former U.S. President Donald Trump visited the site of the train derailment. A Republican, Trump said that he thinks it is ""terrible"" that sitting U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, has not yet visited the village. East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway told reporters during Trump's visit that this has been a ""very difficult situation"" as the village is struggling to deal with the fallout of the derailment. Norfolk Southern announced on Wednesday that it would excavate the soil and replace the tracks in the derailment area ""as part of an enhanced remediation plan."" The railroad corporation said it had excavated more than 4,800 cubic yards of soil, or approximately 400 truckloads. Additionally, 1.7 million gallons, or approximately 200 tanker loads, of liquid had been collected for disposal.",Xinhua,2023-02-24 08:22
94,"One year on, Ukraine crisis accentuates calls for peace","   MOSCOW/KIEV, Feb. 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Ukraine traded a fresh round of strikes as the world is set to mark the first anniversary of the armed conflict on Friday. The crisis has caused many casualties, displaced numerous people, aggravated geopolitical confrontation in Europe, intensified global energy and food shortages, and undermined regional and international security. While Russia and Ukraine appear to have reached a deadlock on the battlefield and at the negotiating table, the United States continues to agitate the conflict and profit from it.    ""Over the past year, from work to my personal life, from my well-being to what I do every day, everything has completely changed,"" said a volunteer worker at a children's hospital in Kiev, who gave her name as Olha. ""I lost my job ... I have outstanding loans ... My friends have died,"" the 34-year-old told Xinhua. Since the conflict flared up on Feb. 24 last year, tens of thousands of troops on both sides have been killed, and millions of others were forced to flee their homes. The echoes of the conflict are heard far beyond Ukraine's borders. Its heavy toll on the world has manifested through food supply chain disruptions, skyrocketing energy prices and soaring inflation. Western countries have imposed sanctions on Russia in hopes of choking its energy export channels and destroying its economy. However, those sanctions have backfired, hurt U.S. allies and triggered a worldwide energy crisis. Furthermore, Ukraine and Russia jointly produce around 30 percent of the world's wheat exports. Russia is also one of the world's biggest exporters of fertilizers. The impact of the conflict on food supply chains has contributed to rising food prices, making it harder for people in lower and middle-income economies to feed their families. As the conflict disrupts trade and aggravates inflation for essential goods, several economies teeter on the brink of recession.   In a blog released in late January, IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas reckoned the global economy is poised to slow this year, while growth will remain weak by historical standards as the fight against inflation and the Ukraine crisis weigh on activity. The economic pain has been quite intense for emerging economies. The UN warned on Jan. 1 that the Russia-Ukraine conflict unleashed a new crisis, disrupting food and energy markets and exacerbating food insecurity and malnutrition in many developing countries.   During the Munich Security Conference concluded on Sunday, there was ""palpable frustration among some leaders from African and South American nations"" over the protracted conflict, which ""was consuming the time, money and attention of the West at the expense of other pressing problems,"" the Financial Times observed. ""We don't want to go on discussing who will be the winner or the loser of a war,"" said Colombia's Vice President Francia Marquez. ""We are all losers and, in the end, it is humankind that loses everything.""  The deep cause of the Russia-Ukraine conflict is the expansion of NATO, and ""the Russians are reacting to the West's attempt to make Ukraine a western bulwark on Russia's border,"" John Mearsheimer, political science professor at the University of Chicago, told Xinhua. Breaking a promise made at the end of the Cold War that NATO would not expand to the east, the U.S.-led bloc has expanded eastward five times since 1999, advancing more than 1,000 km to the Russian border. Its membership has increased from 16 to 30 countries. Since the flare-up, the United States and its allies have sent more weapons to Ukraine, worsening the situation. The United States has promised nearly 30 billion U.S. dollars in military assistance to Ukraine. After the United States and Germany pledged tanks to Ukraine in late January, the Pentagon announced a new tranche of military aid for Ukraine days later, including long-range precision rockets for the first time.   During his surprise trip to Kiev on Monday, U.S. President Joe Biden announced hundreds of millions of dollars in additional military aid for Ukraine, a move widely expected to escalate the crisis further. Washington's latest move bears out what former U.S. senator Richard Black said last year -- ""We don't care how many Ukrainians die. How many women, children, civilians, military will die. We do not care. It's like a great football game, and we want to win."" In his address to the Federal Assembly, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the West sparked a war in Europe to ""eliminate competitors by using a proxy force,"" and the responsibility for inciting and escalating the Ukraine crisis lies entirely with the Western elites. ""They plan to grow a local conflict into a global confrontation ... But it is impossible to defeat Russia on the battlefield,"" he said. Simultaneously, Washington's ""football game"" on the bloody battlefield in Ukraine brings fortunes to U.S. war and energy businesses. Replacing the military equipment transferred to Ukraine by Washington's NATO allies could lead to roughly 21.7 billion dollars in foreign military sales or direct commercial sales for American industry, the U.S. Foundation for Defense of Democracies said in a report last month. As for the energy industry, ""Big Oil just reported its profits. Record profits. Last year, they made 200 billion dollars in the midst of a global energy crisis,"" Biden admitted in his State of the Union Address on Feb. 7.  The prolonged crisis has created economic and social woes in both countries and significantly retarded the world's post-pandemic recovery. Official data showed that Russia's GDP declined by 2.1 percent in 2022, and the Ukrainian economy nosedived by 30.4 percent. The World Bank estimated last year that the cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine is at least 349 billion dollars. However, the vast difference in positions between Russia and Ukraine seems unbridgeable for the time being, making possible dialogue difficult. When meeting senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi in Munich on Saturday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said no other countries want to realize peace more than Ukraine. For the sake of peace, Gulru Gezer, a foreign policy analyst and former diplomat for Türkiye, believes all responsible countries that do not want to prolong the crisis should help keep the channels of dialogue open rather than exacerbate tensions.   UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the one-year mark is a ""grim milestone"" with an impact far beyond Ukraine. ""While prospects may look bleak today, we know that genuine, lasting peace must be based on the UN Charter and international law,"" he said. Among the countries standing on the side of peace and dialogue is China, which plans to publish a document on finding a political settlement to the crisis. In The Global Security Initiative Concept Paper released on Tuesday, China pledges to promote a political settlement to international and regional hotspot issues, including in Ukraine. Leaders of some countries have made clear their neutrality on the issue, criticizing the West for leveraging the Ukraine issue as ""a loyalty test"" and calling for a political settlement. In Munich, when asked why Namibia abstained from a UN resolution on the Ukraine situation in October, Prime Minister Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila said her country focused on ""resolving the problem, not on shifting blame."" ""The bottom line is that money used to buy weapons would be better used to promote development in Ukraine, in Africa, in Asia, in the EU itself, where many people are facing hardships,"" Kuugongelwa-Amadhila said.",Xinhua,2023-02-24 08:34

71,Europe in the grip of unprecedented winter drought,"ROME, Feb. 23 (Xinhua) -- Large swathes of Europe are currently in the midst of an unprecedented winter drought, which could impact agriculture and human consumption, and lead to problems in the warmer months. According to the European Union's (EU) Drought Observatory, northern Italy, south-central France, eastern Spain, and parts of Greece, Germany, Austria, and Croatia all have a rainfall deficit this winter. This comes after a record-setting hot and dry summer last year, which left water stores low heading into the colder months. The back-to-back droughts have impacted fishing and irrigation, and limited winter sports. As of Thursday, most of France has gone more than a month without significant rainfall, according to Meteo France. This breaks the record set in the spring of 2020. Moreover, with one week to go before the official end of winter, the total number of winter days without rain is the highest since record-keeping began in 1959. Italy has seen some snow and rainfall this year, but the accumulated rainfall -- especially in the northern parts of the country -- has been so low that the ANBI Water Resource Consortium said Thursday that as many as 3.5 million Italians could be at risk of having to ration drinking water. The organization said that as much as 15 percent of Italy's population lives in areas which are impacted by extreme drought conditions. Meanwhile, in an attempt to curb water use, Spanish officials have established rules limiting car-washing and filling of swimming pools. The low rainfall has resulted in a weak crop of acorns, making it more difficult for pig farmers to feed their animals. Across central Europe, the low levels of precipitation have also resulted in lower snowfall, which has damaged tourism. It will also result in lower levels for glacier-fed rivers and lakes in the spring. The low rainfall in Europe has exacerbated the problems caused by the droughts and heatwaves that lashed the continent in 2022. In addition, the year-old conflict between Russia and Ukraine has further complicated the situation, leading to skyrocketing energy costs combined with increased demand due to the cold and dry conditions. Coldiretti, the main Italian agricultural sector union, said that as much as a quarter of agricultural production in areas impacted by the dry weather could be lost this winter. The weather could change in the coming days, according to media reports. Starting early next week, a weather formation originating in Russia is expected to cause a drop in temperatures in central and northern Italy, and into the Alps and southern France. However, despite the lower temperatures, the change in weather is not expected to bring a significant increase in rainfall.",Xinhua,2023-02-24 08:48

The CBI issued on Wednesday a package of measures aiming to support the stability of the exchange rates of the Iraqi dinar and facilitate access to foreign currencies in the country, said Ammar al-Ibrahimi, an official with the media office of Iraq's Federal Board of Supreme Audit. According to the CBI measures, the first option is to use the central bank's yuan reserves to boost the balances of the Iraqi banks that have accounts in Chinese banks, al-Ibrahimi explained. The second option is to convert the dollars in the central bank's accounts at the JP Morgan and the Development Bank of Singapore to yuan for payment to the final beneficiaries in China, he said. The measures will facilitate the operations of those traders who have dealings with Chinese banks and companies, as the Iraqi market is teeming with goods from China, one of the major importers of Iraqi oil, he said. The latest CBI measures show the growing importance of the Chinese yuan in international markets, al-Ibrahimi added.

76,Ukraine crisis brings EU's strategic autonomy back into spotlight,"ROME, Feb. 23 (Xinhua) -- The conflict in Ukraine has brought the decades-old issue of the European Union's (EU) strategic autonomy back into the spotlight, according to analysts. In many ways, the United States has been a leader in setting policies that have backed the Ukrainian cause, with European countries largely following its steps. Ukraine has benefited from strong support from the EU as well. But analysts say it is clear the U.S. has taken the leading role. ""The powers the EU has in regard to foreign policy and security policy are very limited compared to the powers it has in other policy areas,"" Mattia Guidi, a political scientist at Rome's LUISS University, told Xinhua. He says there are multiple reasons for that, including the depth of the influence of the United States and the way geopolitical issues are decided in Europe. ""The EU makes decisions based on a unanimity rule, which means that it is necessary to put all 27 member states around a table and find a solution that fits everyone,"" Guidi said. ""That is very difficult. What usually happens is that with foreign and security policy, the European Union can't decide anything substantial."" That was the case earlier this month, when Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky met with European leaders in Brussels for the European Council summit on Feb. 9. There was consensus in terms of pledging continued support for Ukraine, but wide differences remained on what that meant: some countries wanted to support Ukraine in possible peace talks, some wanted to limit support to financial mechanisms, and others wanted to continue military support. There was also criticism from Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni that the trilateral talks between Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Paris one day before the summit were ""inappropriate"" given the unanimity principle, Guidi said. Analysts say those issues have increased the influence of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which is now the principal support framework for Ukraine, and one that had already started to support Kiev years before the conflict broke out. Facing a large-scale conflict at its door, the EU's capacity was limited in how it could respond. At the same time, NATO has expanded military presence on its eastern flank. Its regular defense ministers' meeting and the larger Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting at the U.S. airbase in Ramstein, rather than the EU Council of foreign and defense ministers, now make decisions concerning the conflict. ""NATO is already there. It is a more functional organization for managing these issues, and it is where, of course, the United States plays a central role,"" Guidi said. ""It's also easy for this shift to take place because there is such a large overlap between NATO and the EU."" NATO has 30 member states, including 21 members of the EU. Two more EU member states, Sweden and Finland, are in the process of joining NATO, while multiple non-EU NATO member states are seeking EU membership. According to Ingo Peters, a foreign policy expert at the Free University of Berlin, the issue of the strategic autonomy of the EU is one that has often come to the surface in the past, since the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s. ""The strategic autonomy of Europe has already been favored by some, but not by all,"" Peters, who is currently a visiting scholar at the Center for European Studies at the U.S. University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, told Xinhua. ""Germany, for example, has always said that the EU should not go forward without the United States, which it has said is something essential to strengthening the European Union,"" Peters said. Germany reportedly agreed to send advanced Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine in late January only after the United States decided to send M1 Abrams tanks. ""There are historic reasons for this, since we Germans believe there is a need for United States influence in Europe as a kind of external balance in order to keep our friends and neighbors calm,"" Peters said. Germany is EU's largest economy, but Peters noted it has not always been a major player in issues related to international relations and security in part due to its legacy from the two World Wars of the 20th century. But that has begun to evolve in the year since the Ukraine conflict began, Peters said. ""Over the last months, Europe's strategic autonomy has been given a reality check,"" said Ulrike Franke, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. ""Europe needs to become stronger and more united, less immediately dependent on a United States that is less and less keen to focus its efforts, attention and money on Europe,"" Franke said.",Xinhua,2023-02-24 09:10

62,Black-owned businesses still comprise small share in U.S. despite growth: study,"NEW YORK, Feb. 23 (Xinhua) -- While Black-owned businesses in the United States have grown significantly in recent years, they still make up a small share of firms and revenue in the country, a Pew Research Center analysis has indicated. In 2020, there were an estimated 140,918 U.S. firms with majority Black or African American ownership, up 14 percent from 124,004 in 2017, according to the latest available data from the Census Bureau's Annual Business Survey. Despite this growth, businesses majority-owned by Black or African American people accounted for only 3 percent of all U.S. firms that were classifiable by the race and ethnicity of their owners in 2020.

63,Japan beefs up moves in seeking G7 support for wastewater dump,"Amid backlash from domestic and the international community, the Japanese government reportedly is to seek the endorsement of the Group of Seven (G7) nations for its controversial plan to discharge radioactive contaminated wastewater from the crippled nuclear power plant in Fukushima Prefecture into the Pacific Ocean. Analysts criticized countries that are giving a go-ahead signal to Japan's irresponsible dumping plan, noting they will share the shame of making irreversible damage to maritime environment and human health. As this year's chair, Japan is seeking to include a phrase that says the G7 members ""welcome"" its ""transparent"" approach toward the disposal of the treated water in a document to be released after the April 15 to 16 gathering in Sapporo, Japanese media Kyodo News reported citing government sources. In January, the Japanese government and the plant operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, announced the plan to begin discharging the treated water around this spring or summer, with construction work underway to install an undersea tunnel and other necessary facilities. Analysts said that Japan has beefed up efforts in soliciting support from the US and Western countries for its disposal of the Fukushima radioactive contaminated wastewater and in promoting its narrative of the ""safety"" of the wastewater amid growing oppositions from domestic public, neighboring countries and other stakeholders. Against the backdrop of the Ukraine crisis and current tense Korean Peninsula situation, Japan is working to create the momentum for its dumping plan especially among Western countries as other G7 nations are also members of NATO and the military pact is seeking closer cooperation with Japan, Da Zhigang, director of the Institute of Northeast Asian Studies at the Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times. This is not the first time for Japan to try to include the Fukushima nuclear wastewater issue into the G7 declaration. In May 2016, after the Ise-Shima Summit in Japan, the G7 Leaders' Declaration wrote about ""steady progress on decommissioning and treatment of contaminated water"" as well as ""Japan's efforts to proceed in an open and transparent manner in close communication with the international community."" The US also expressed support for its close ally in Asia. In April 2021, after the Japanese government mentioned the plan to release more than 1 million metric tons of treated radioactive water, the US Department of State said in a statement that Japan ""appears to have adopted an approach in accordance with globally accepted nuclear safety standards."" However, fancy words from the US and the G7 cannot gloss over the increasing questions over the safety of the ""treated"" wastewater, the transparency of Japan's processing of the contaminated water and its consultations on the disposal with related neighboring countries, analysts said. Pacific island nations also urged Japan to delay the release of the contaminated water over fears fisheries will be contaminated and that the health of people will be affected. For example, during a livestreamed public meeting in Suva, Fiji on January 18, the Pacific Island Forum Secretary General Henry Puna said, ""Our region is steadfast that there be no discharge until all parties verify it is safe."" At the Security Council session on February 14 over Japan's discharge of nuclear-contaminated water, both representatives from China and Russia expressed concerns over the issue. Ambassador Zhang Jun, Permanent Representative of China to the UN, made China's position clear, stressing that ""Japan's discharge of nuclear contaminated water into the sea will severely endanger the global marine environment, ecosystems, and the lives and health of people of all countries."" ""Japan has been bent on forcibly approving the discharge program of the nuclear contaminated water and has been accelerating the preparations for the discharge. Such behavior is extremely irresponsible,"" said Zhang.  The Japanese government sees the plan of dumping the contaminated water into the ocean as the most ""economic"" way to get rid of the burden from the destroyed Fukushima nuclear power plant. But people in Japan, neighboring countries and the world will pay the price given the irreversible damage to environment and human health, Zhou Yongsheng, deputy director of the Japanese Studies Center at China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times. The Japanese government will be condemned and held accountable if it irresponsibly discharges contaminated nuclear wastewater into the ocean and countries that give green light to Tokyo's moves will also share the shame, said Zhou. Concerns expressed by UN human rights experts, global nongovernmental organizations and activists from all over the world and their own countries may make G7 countries to consider more than only political leverage, analysts said. As far back as 2021, independent experts appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council have expressed deep regret on Japan's decision to release contaminated water into the ocean. They noted that the water processing technology known as ALPS had failed to completely remove radioactive concentrations in most of the contaminated water stored in tanks at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. The radioactive hazards of tritium in the water, which cannot be removed, have been underestimated and can be detrimental to humans and pose threat to the environment for over 100 years. Japanese fisheries and Japanese people will be the first to be affected and the whole world will also suffer as oceans are linked. If the US and other G7 nations are the real protectors of the environment and human rights as they like to trumpet, they should have opposed Japanese government's transboundary environmental harms, said Zhou. As Japanese activists have staged protests against the government's discharge plan for years, analysts called on more countries to join them and the neighboring countries in urging the Japanese government to stop making irreparable damage to the world.",By Liu Xin (Global Times) ,2023-02-24 09:58

61,"U.S. using ""spy balloons"" for decades: Fox News","WASHINGTON, Feb. 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States has been using what can accurately be called ""spy balloons"" for decades, Fox News has said. During World War I, the Goodyear Aerospace Corporation used its Akron air dock to build dirigibles to carry military payloads. More recently, the same air dock was used by Lockheed Martin to develop smaller balloons called aerostats, which can carry radar, infrared cameras, and more as their payload, said the report on Tuesday. Many of these lighter-than-air ""spy"" craft were used along the U.S. borders to detect drug smugglers flying into clandestine airstrips in the country, the report quoted Joseph Huber, who worked as a part of the team, as saying. The report also mentioned that in 2015, Lockheed Martin tested a smaller ""spy balloon"" in Akron, Ohio, the payload of which was kept a secret. Huber said the smaller versions of the Aerostat were used by the military in the Middle East to watch enemy combatants, a surveillance program called the Persistent Threat Detection System. ""They would stay up for several days at a time, bring them down quickly and refurbish and send them back up again, watching people coming in and putting explosives in the road and people trying to come in and make an attack on the base,"" Huber added.",Xinhua,2023-02-24 13:20
59,U.S. witnesses bloodiest weekend of gun violence so far in 2023,"NEW YORK, Feb. 24 (Xinhua) -- Nine mass shootings took place in the United States over the weekend, resulting in 13 deaths and over 40 injuries, according to the data from Gun Violence Archive, making it the bloodiest weekend of gun violence so far in 2023. On the heels of several high-profile mass shootings in California last month and an attack at Michigan State University on Feb. 13, nine mass shootings in a single weekend is ""certainly high for this time of year,"" according to local media. As of Feb. 19, there have been 81 mass shootings so far this year, compared to 59 during the same period last year. Mark Bryant, executive director of the Gun Violence Archive, was quoted in a USA Today article as saying that ""the number of shootings over the weekend is unusual for mid-February in the U.S."" Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, told USA Today that mass shootings underscored ongoing inaction from state and federal lawmakers. Almost all states witnessing mass shootings over the weekend don't require a license to carry concealed loaded guns. ""Instead, state lawmakers have pushed Right to Carry laws that either eliminate the need to get a license to carry concealed guns or make getting such a license very easy,"" Webster said. ""But the 'more guns everywhere' approach has been found to increase violent crime and does nothing to reduce mass shootings."" Researchers on gun violence say legislative disorder in the United States has fueled gun violence severity. A case in point was the U.S. Supreme Court decision in June 2022 to strike down a New York state law that limits gun-carrying in public. The high court's ruling that set new standards for evaluating gun laws left many open questions, resulting in an increasing number of conflicting decisions as lower court judges need help figuring out how to apply it, the Associated Press reported. In several instances, judges looking at the same laws have come down on opposite sides on whether they are constitutional in the wake of the conservative Supreme Court's majority ruling, it reported, calling the phenomenon ""legal turmoil,"" for which the Supreme Court needs to step in soon to provide more guidance for judges. The weekend also put a 3-billion-U.S.-dollar industry of companies working to ""protect children or employees"" into the limelight, as gun violence particularly ravaged U.S. schools in recent months, like the attack at the elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, last year, and the tragedy at Michigan State University last week. As the New York Times listed, the offerings are numerous: automatically locking doors, bullet-resistant tables, Kevlar backpacks, artificial intelligence that detects guns and countless types of training exercises, like breathing techniques to avoid panic during an attack or strategies for how to use a pencil to pierce a shooter's eyes. However, the effectiveness of such products and services must still be proven. Calling it an entire industry that capitalizes on school shootings, Odis Johnson, the executive director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Safe and Healthy Schools, said that these companies have very little evidence that what they are selling works.",Xinhua,2023-02-24 13:29

According to the study, economic welfare losses estimated in terms of national income growth supplemented by the value of lives lost was approximately 3.57 trillion U.S. dollars. Because of longstanding socioeconomic inequities, the losses caused by COVID-19 have not been evenly distributed, the study said, stressing that the scale of life expectancy and welfare losses underscores the pressing need to invest in health in the United States.",Xinhua,2023-02-24 14:28
58,US society wrong to unleash anti-Asia hate,"  Just in the recent past, two new anti-Chinese hate incidents have been identified with the left in the United States. The cases are different, but the bias is not. One stems from liberal educators who kept secret the notifications of students who had attained National Merit Scholar status in order to advance equity (dictated by the deep state and opposed to the equality of opportunity that is an American tradition). The second is the case of Asians killed during the Chinese New Year celebrations in Los Angeles. The first involved mostly Asian students — 75 percent of the victims are of Asian origin with the majority of them being Chinese — who excelled in their high school in Virginia. Left-leaning schoolteachers and principals withheld news of the merit scholar list ostensibly to not offend students who were not high achievers and to advance equity. Many of the students who were kept in the dark about their merit status were cheated out of money in the form of a scholarship and/or an accolade that would have helped them get admission to a good university and likely a scholarship. The students were not informed on time to meet university application deadlines as the official merit lists were kept at the school or were with teachers or school officials for a week or more. The students were ""robbed"" and their academic career scarred. Most were discriminated against because of their race and because they are intelligent, hardworking and driven to excel. Critics argue that this policy is not only racist, but also demeans the US and puts the country at a disadvantage in global competition against China and other countries at a time when the US is in decline and fast losing its status as a great power. Some even compare it to Hitler's pogroms of Jews during World War II, which forced many Jewish scientists to migrate to the US where they helped build the atomic bomb, which brought the war to an end, and later played a crucial role in the US' space program that led to American astronauts landing on the moon. Similarly, many Chinese scientists have returned home in recent times because of the anti-Chinese hate crimes and the Biden administration's anti-China policies. What the school administrations and teachers did is said to have advanced the American Teachers Association's liberal ideas. Yet the incident came to light only after students at Thomas Jefferson High School in northern Virginia, the top high school in the US according to the US News and World Reports, complained to the higher authorities about the discrimination. But many say that this has been happening in schools elsewhere in the US for some time now. However, Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin, a conservative Republican just elected to office, took measures to make the practice unconstitutional, for which he has been widely applauded so much that some people have said he has a chance of becoming the Republican Party's candidate for president in 2024. The second anti-Asian hate incident occurred in Los Angeles. In a violent attack on a Lunar New Year event, 11 people were killed and nine injured. Since the perpetrator was a person of Vietnamese origin who subsequently killed himself, details about his motives are not certain. The history of anti-Asian killings and racial discrimination against Asians in Los Angeles is legend. According to the Los Angeles Times, anti-Asian hate crimes increased 177 percent in Los Angeles in 2021, with some California officials calling it an ""epidemic of hate"". The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism says Los Angeles is the number one city in the US when it comes to the number of hate crimes. Many crime suspects in Los Angeles are not prosecuted owing to the extremely liberal policies of the city government under district attorney George Gascon, who was elected with the help of George Soros, a financier with leftist views who contributed $2 million to Gascon's election campaign. Gascon's policy of going soft on many perpetrators of hate crimes has hit Asians hard, with many protesting against him and his administration. Defending the police, to many Asians, has become an excuse for not enforcing the law when the victims of hate crimes are Asians with people of Chinese origin being at the top of the list. USA Today reported that Monterey Park, the small suburb of Los Angeles County sometimes called the Chinese Beverly Hills, where the incident occurred, was the site of a disproportionate number of incidents of anti-Asian violence and crimes. Monterey Park is known in Los Angeles as an Asian haven, with two-thirds of its residents being Asians, almost 50 percent of whom are Chinese. The mayor is Chinese as are a number of other city officials. Many say a large share of business in the city is conducted in Mandarin. Monterey is a prosperous place, and eschews teaching woke and following leftist ideals, provoking the left in Los Angeles. The media often reports that hate against Asians intensified after previous US president Donald Trump said the novel coronavirus originated in China, and called COVID-19 the ""kung flu"" and launched the trade war with China. A Pew Foundation poll, however, showed this is not a serious concern to Americans. No wonder students at Harvard, led by Chinese students, sued the university for racial bias, alleging that the number of Asian students would be double in the university if it were not for the racial bias in the admission policy. While Trump supported their suit when he was in office, in a similar suit filed by students at Yale during Biden's tenure, the Department of Justice refused to hear the case. Behind the anti-Asian, anti-Chinese in particular, hate crimes is the ill-will espoused by the mainstream media toward China, alleging that China is trying to destroy the liberal world order, spying on the US, stealing US technology, and perpetrating human rights abuses. This is blatant provocative propaganda, aimed at inciting anti-Chinese sentiments in the US which must be exposed for what it is.  ", (China Daily) ,2023-02-24 15:04
66,Whole world pays price for US sanctions: China Daily editorial,"While US President Joe Biden reiterated the need for additional sanctions on Russia in a speech in Poland on Tuesday, Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo was a little more specific in a speech he delivered at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington on the same day. Attributing the reports that Russia has had to turn to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Iran to resupply its military with drones and surface-to-surface missiles to the effectiveness of the US-led sanctions, Adeyemo said that the United States plans to announce additional sanctions this week targeting Russia's military manufacturing industry. ""While we have far more to do, we are succeeding in reversing the course of Russia's budget and undercutting its military-industrial complex,"" said Adeyemo, pledging that the additional sanctions will focus on cracking down on sanctions evasion and putting economic pressure on countries and corporations that continue to do business with Russia. Over 30 countries have imposed price caps on Russian energy exports, instituted export controls, frozen Russian funds and restricted its access to SWIFT, a global financial transaction system. However, the sanctions are being imposed without the United Nations' authorization and have no legitimacy in international laws. The great lengths the US is going to in its efforts to claim the moral high ground by portraying the sanctions as actions for democracy indicate how desperate it is to cover up the nature of the sanctions, which are simply geopolitical weapons wielded by Washington in a bid to bleed Russia's economy in world trade and Russian military on the battlefields in Ukraine. Although those following the US' lead in imposing sanctions represent more than half the world's economy combined, they only account for about one-sixth of the number of countries and regions in the world and they are mostly developed economies. In weaponizing trade, technology and finance with the sanctions, the US has formed a gang at the top of the global supply, industry and value chains so that it can impose its will on the rest of the world through long-arm jurisdiction and replace the rules of the international order in various sectors with US rules. Yet Russia's economy is performing better than expected. This year, its economy is projected to outperform the UK's, growing 0.3 percent, while the UK faces a 0.6 percent contraction, according to the International Monetary Fund. It is clear that the sanctions bite both ways if not more on those that impose them — an energy shortage has forced some leading European economies, including Germany, to remap the upgrading path of their industries. The IMF reported last month that Russia's economy would contract by just 2.2 percent in 2022, far less than the 8.5 percent envisaged by the West in March 2022 when it started imposing large-scale sanctions on the country. The report also projects that business activity in Russia will grow by 0.3 percent in 2023 and 2.1 percent in 2024, directly outpacing the 1.6 percent projected for the eurozone. Now is the time for the world to ask for how long will it continue to tolerate, if not pay for, the US continuing to manipulate the international rules through illegal sanctions under a noble disguise for its own hegemony.",Chinadaily.com.cn,2023-02-24 15:12

43,Heat-related deaths hit 20-year high in U.S. Texas last year: report,"HOUSTON, Feb. 24 (Xinhua) -- Heat-related deaths in south central U.S. state Texas last year hit a two-decade new high amid a sharp rise in migrant deaths and soaring temperatures enhanced by climate change, according to a Texas Tribune report on Friday. At least 279 people in Texas were killed by heat in 2022, the highest annual toll for the state since at least 1999, said the report based on the newspaper's analysis of state data. Many of the dead were likely migrants who died after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, the report noted. The U.S. Border Patrol reported locating 853 bodies along the entire U.S.-Mexico border in the 2022 fiscal year ending Sept. 30. The figure included deaths from heat, drowning and other causes. Texas also saw its second-hottest summer on record during its worst drought in more than a decade, said the report, citing data provided by state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon. The population in the second largest U.S. state grew from just over 20 million in 1999 to around 30 million in 2022.",Xinhua,2023-02-25 10:22

36,Germany mum on Nord Stream explosions amid U.S. sabotage claims,"BERLIN, Feb. 24 (Xinhua) -- The German government is keeping mum about the explosions that destroyed the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines on Sept. 26 last year, although the country continues to suffer from a severe energy crisis following the disruption of Russian gas supplies. Not even allowing access to members of the German Bundestag (lower house of Parliament), all information on the matter has been classified as ""highly confidential"" because of the so-called third-party rule that prevents conflicts with the interests of allied states or their intelligence services. An article by Pulitzer Prize-winning American journalist Seymour Hersh claims that the United States was behind the explosions of the pipelines. Before 2022, Russia supplied more than half of the gas consumed in Germany. Europe's largest economy has had to completely rethink its energy policy, including the use of old coal-fired power plants and imports of more expensive liquefied natural gas (LNG).  The collective silence of governments in Europe has created a news vacuum that is now being filled. In his article, Hersh alleged that U.S. divers covertly planted the explosives on the Nord Stream pipelines under the guise of a widely publicized mid-summer North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) exercise. Hersh wrote that three months later, the remotely triggered detonation destroyed three of the four pipelines. The article's source was described as a person with ""direct knowledge of the operational planning."" Washington has publicly opposed the Nord Stream pipelines for a long time and U.S. President Joe Biden's declaration at a joint White House press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Feb. 7 last year also leaves little room for interpretation. In the event of a special military operation by Russia in Ukraine, Biden clearly stated that ""there will be ... no longer a Nord Stream 2. We will bring an end to it."" When asked by a journalist how this was possible since the project was in Germany's control, he simply added, ""I'll promise you, we will be able to do it.""  This week, Denmark, Germany and Sweden told the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) in a joint letter that investigations are ""ongoing."" Nothing was said about who is responsible. They only stated that ""investigations have not yet been concluded"" and ""it is not possible to say when they will be concluded."" German industrial and domestic energy markets benefitted enormously from the cheap natural gas coming straight into its Lubmin Nord Stream 1 terminals. The United States, however, has become increasingly concerned about this reliance on Russian energy and the weakening of the U.S. energy export market. Following the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines, the United States is set to increase its LNG exports. At a press conference, Secretary of State Antony Blinken asserted that ""it is a tremendous opportunity to once and for all remove the dependence on Russian energy."" Russia has requested the UNSC to conduct an independent inquiry into the explosions on the Nord Stream pipelines.",Xinhua,2023-02-25 10:29
32,Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5 accounts for 85 pct new COVID-19 cases in U.S.,"LOS ANGELES, Feb. 24 (Xinhua) -- The highly transmissible Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5 now accounts for 85 percent of all COVID-19 cases reported in the United States this week, according to the latest estimates of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The prevalence of XBB.1.5 kept increasing since late last year. It is up from 79.2 percent last week and 71.9 percent two weeks prior. XBB.1.5 is growing in proportion in all regions nationwide, according to the CDC. BQ.1.1 remains the second most prevalent strain at 9.4 percent. The CDC first started tracking XBB.1.5 in November last year, when it accounted for less than 1 percent of cases nationwide. Since then, the strain is spreading quickly in the United States. Early study suggests XBB.1.5 has a couple of concerning mutations that suggest it is even more contagious than other strains, possibly the most transmissible one so far. While XBB.1.5 is spreading easier, scientists said it does not seem to cause more severe disease.",Xinhua,2023-02-25 10:31

Rescue teams have identified 13 minors among the dead, the Sao Paulo state government said in a statement. The municipalities of Sao Sebastiao, Ubatuba, Caraguatuatuba, Ilhabela and Bertioga were the most severely affected by the rainfall, which in less than 24 hours was twice as heavy as expected for all of February, marking a new record in Brazil. The rains caused landslides in the Serra do Mar mountain range along the coast, where key tourist resorts are located, sweeping away homes in poor neighborhoods on the hillsides, where about 4,000 people fled or lost their homes. The disaster is focused in Vila do Sahy, the most affected community, located next to the exclusive beaches of Baleia and Camburi, in the municipality of Sao Sebastiao. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva proposed this week to the Sao Sebastiao mayor's office the construction of housing in flat areas outside risk areas for those who have lost their homes. In addition, Sao Paulo governor Tarcisio de Freitas proposed the installation of a siren system, like that in other mountain areas at risk of landslides, since the telephone warning system in use was not effective.",Xinhua,2023-02-25 10:39

47,Union officials say cost cutting led to significant derailments in U.S.: ABC News,"NEW YORK, Feb. 24 (Xinhua) -- Years of cost cutting and staff reductions within the freight rail industry have led to an increase in the rate of derailments and fostered an increasingly unsafe environment for workers and the public, ABC News on Wednesday cited national union officials. Their comments preceded a Feb. 19 letter from Transportation Secretary Peter Buttigieg in which he accused rail companies of spending millions on lobbying efforts to oppose safety regulations rather than support rail safety, according to the report. Union officials did not directly connect what they say is the degradation of safety measures, to the derailment of a Norfolk Southern train in East Palestine, Ohio, where toxic chemicals were released into the air and water sources, forcing nearly 2,000 residents to evacuate their homes and leaving lingering environmental concerns. ""However, their letter demanding increased federal oversight was directly prompted by the incident, renewing their stance in the long-simmering debate about the increased focus on profit at the expense of public safety,"" said the report. Union leaders called for increased federal oversight of the largest freight railroads, which they allege have ""cut corners"" and initiated practices that ""pose real threats to workers and public safety,"" it added.",Xinhua,2023-02-25 10:51

51,UN tourism body hails reopening of China for tourism,"MADRID, Feb. 24 (Xinhua) -- The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) on Thursday hailed the importance of the reopening of China for tourism, given the country's huge importance to the global tourism market. ""The reopening of China represents the 'missing piece' in the recovery of world tourism after the worst crisis in its history,"" the UNWTO said in a press release. In 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, China was the world's largest outbound tourism market. Chinese tourists made 166 million international trips, and spent 270 billion U.S. dollars, much of it in destinations in developing economies, according to UNWTO data. Almost 3 trillion U.S. dollars in tourist revenues were lost globally between 2020 and 2022 due to the pandemic. Therefore, the organization said the lifting of Chinese travel restrictions will benefit the entire world. Chinese citizens made 6 billion domestic trips in 2019, the UNWTO said, adding this shows that tourism is a key driver of employment and economic growth, including for rural communities in China. The trickle-down effect of China's reopening will also benefit other economic sectors, helping to create greater dynamism at local, national and global level, the UNWTO said. A delegation from the UNWTO, led by Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili, traveled from the Spanish capital Madrid to Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang Province, to attend an event celebrating the reopening of China for tourism.

Kani-Bonzon is one of the villages that have not pledged allegiance."" Residents took to the streets in Bandiagara on Friday to denounce the attack and demand more security.

Von der Leyen and Sunak ""agreed to continue their work in person towards shared, practical solutions for the range of complex challenges around the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland,"" the statement said. A dispute over the Northern Ireland Protocol -- the rules governing post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland -- has strained Britain's relations with the European Union (EU). Under the protocol, Northern Ireland is part of British customs territory but is subject to the EU's customs code, value-added tax rules and single market rules for goods. However, a de facto Irish Sea border was thus created between the British mainland and Northern Ireland, meaning goods transported to and from Northern Ireland are subject to border controls. Northern Ireland's pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party has demanded the removal or replacement of the protocol as a precondition for it to sit in the assembly and form a devolved government.",Xinhua,2023-02-27 08:18
55,"Interview: It's illogical U.S. spends much on wars, very little on infrastructure, says renowned anti-war activist","  NEW YORK, Feb. 26 (Xinhua) -- ""It isn't logical at all"" the United States spends so many tax dollars on wars overseas and very little is left for infrastructure or any sort of services at home, a renowned anti-war activist has said. ""It's very dangerous what they're doing all over the world. We're neglecting things at home,"" Eric Garris, director of Antiwar.com, a premier anti-war website in the United States, told Xinhua in an interview on Wednesday. ""Look at what just happened in Ohio with that horrible polluting train wreck... All the government seems to be interested in is to stoke tensions and be the bully,"" said Garris, who started to march in civil rights demonstrations at age 8. Noting that the United States spends ""a higher percentage of its budget on military by far than any other country on Earth,"" Garris warned of the dire consequences of the U.S. wars overseas. ""We are killing lots of people, and the results are not coming the way they (U.S. politicians) promise, and it's only getting worse, and it could get very, very bad. It's very, very scary. That's why we have to build a movement in this country that relies on talking to people and getting out this information,"" said Garris, referring to recent anti-war rallies in 15 major U.S. cities, including Washington D.C.. Garris noted it seems that the Biden administration's only solution to the Ukraine-Russia conflict is ""not to promote diplomacy, is not to promote ways to resolve differences, but rather to stoke them. And this is really, really bad."" ""What they're doing is they are trying to exert their own supremacy over Europe. And they think that Russia is the main enemy for that supremacy,"" he said. ""And in fact what we're doing is we are building up these alliances that are reminiscent of the beginning of World War I where you had a very small spark in a very small place that sparked World War."" ""The difference between that and today is that today you have nuclear weapons. And so it becomes a much, much different potential outcome. And it's very, very dangerous. And we need to take a look at World War I and see the lessons of what happened when you create these alliances ... With nuclear weapons, it's a completely different situation and can lead to just catastrophic results,"" said Garris. One of the big reasons that the United States is so obsessed with wars is ""the defense industry has found a way for them to be rich,"" said Garris. ""And you have a lot of politicians that are getting rich by voting for these wars. They get their money from the defense industry. They get their money investing in defense stocks. Members of Congress are not prohibited from investing in defense stocks,"" he said. ""It's just awful. And they have no regard for the people that they're supposedly representing. And it's becoming fairly obvious and I hope that people wake up before it's too late,"" said Garris, adding ""unfortunately so much of the American media has become bought out by these special interests."" ""I hope the American people can tell their politicians that ... enough is enough. We need to stop this. We need to focus on trying to make peace and nothing else abroad. That's the only thing that we should be doing,"" he said. ""If we keep going in the direction we're going, not only will we bankrupt ourselves, but we could destroy the world. And that's very, very scary ... The United States needs to get out of Ukraine. We need to, you know, not escalate there. We need to deescalate, we need to demand peace talks and let the disputes be settled,"" Garris said. The United States announced on Feb. 20 an additional 500 million U.S. dollars in military aid for Ukraine on top of the more than 50 billion dollars already promised, a move that is widely believed will further escalate the crisis. The United States and its allies have already committed nearly 700 tanks and thousands of armored vehicles and 1,000 artillery systems, among others.",Xinhua,2023-02-27 08:20

""The longer the brutality, the greater the human suffering."" He called on the parties to the conflict to remain rational, restrain their impulses and prevent the crisis from getting worse or even out of control. Dai reiterated that nuclear weapons cannot be used. ""Nuclear war cannot be fought. All parties should join together against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons, prevent nuclear proliferation and avoid a nuclear crisis,"" he said.  Dai said dialogue and negotiation are ""the only viable way to resolve the Ukraine crisis"". ""The lessons of history tell us that crises can ultimately be resolved peacefully. No matter how difficult it is, the door to a political solution cannot be closed,"" he said. ""We support Russia and Ukraine in resuming direct dialogue as soon as possible, bringing their legitimate concerns into the negotiation, setting out feasible options, and giving a chance to an early end of the crisis and the rebuilding of peace.""

22,New York loses big on surplus COVID-19 gear," A 90-day stockpile of medical supplies for which New York City spent millions of dollars during the COVID-19 pandemic's peak has been sold off for one-fifth of a penny for every dollar spent, media reported. At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, New York City spent $224 million on contracts to purchase around 9.5 million pieces of COVID-19 medical equipment and safety gear. Recently, those items were auctioned off for only $500,000 — about 5 cents per item, according to The City, a nonprofit news website (thecity.nyc). Following The City's investigation, Mayor Eric Adams on Tuesday said he will order a re-examination of the rules governing auctions of government surplus goods. Adams also cited a provision in the city charter that requires the Department of Citywide Administrative Services to sell off goods that are deemed by the agency to no longer be needed. ""I think that needs to be reexamined, and I'm going to communicate with the team and figure out what options do we have, because taxpayers' dollars should be spent better,"" he said. The City said its investigation has revealed that since last summer, DCAS has been attempting to sell millions of dollars' worth of COVID-19-related medical supplies and personal protective equipment such as face shields, gowns, hand sanitizer, KN95 masks and N95 masks. DCAS spokesman Nick Benson told The City that the spending rush during the early days of the pandemic was to create a 90-day supply of medical supplies. Some surplus items had already been donated to Ukraine, Indonesia, Ghana, Haiti, South Africa and nonprofit organizations, he told The City. Auctioning off surplus, he said, ""is required by the city charter"".  The auction included nearly 3,000 mechanical ventilators that cost taxpayers $12 million, according to the investigative report. The ventilators were auctioned off on Jan 24 for just $24,600 as ""nonfunctioning medical equipment for scrap metal"", the website reported. In April 2020, then-mayor Bill de Blasio commissioned the breathing devices and called them ""a story about doing the impossible"". ""Our city is taking our future into our own hands. That's how we'll beat this crisis and prepare for the next,"" he said at the time. A junk dealer from Long Island purchased the entire $12 million, 500,000-pound lot for just about $8 per device, The City reported. Despite being new and in original packaging, many of the items have remained unsold even after being put up for auction. The City said that only two of 24 auctions held last summer resulted in sales, and bidders paid just $194,000 for goods that were originally purchased for $980,000, according to internal DCAS emails, The City reported. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander earlier this month issued a report noting that the city also paid an inflated price for certain items, such as face shields. For example, DCAS, which is handling the sales, purchased some face shields for $12.87 each, 250 percent more than the average price of $3.67. Last week, there were 701,000 face shields reportedly put up for auctions with an opening bid of $1,000, less than 1 cent per shield. DCAS also paid a contracted company as much as $7.50 per cloth mask — 239 percent more than the average price of $2.21 per cloth mask, according to Lander's report. Some products the city bought also came with expiration dates, including 2,800 cases of hand-sanitizing wipes that were set to expire on Jan 31. The administration attempted to sell these wipes for $56,000 on Jan 12, 19 days before the expiration date, The City reported.",By MINLU ZHANG (China Daily) ,2023-02-27 08:37

23,2 Israelis killed in Palestinian drive-by shooting attack,"  JERUSALEM, Feb. 26 (Xinhua) -- Two Israelis were killed in a Palestinian drive-by shooting attack in the occupied West Bank on Sunday amid surging violence in the region, Israeli sources said. Israel's Magen David Adom emergency service said in a statement that the two individuals were in their 20s and had sustained fatal gunshot wounds. They were taken to a hospital in Israel, where they were later pronounced dead. The Israeli army said in a statement that a Palestinian in a passing vehicle opened fire on the two Israelis while they were sitting in a car near the Hawara checkpoint, south of the Palestinian city of Nablus. A large-scale manhunt was launched after the suspects fled the scene. ""IDF (Israel Defense Forces) soldiers are pursuing the terrorists and are blocking the area,"" the statement read. The Hebrew-language Haaretz newspaper quoted eyewitnesses as saying that the shooter was a Palestinian man wearing a shirt of the ""Lion's Den,"" a militant group that emerged over the past year and is quickly gaining popularity. On Wednesday, 11 Palestinians were killed and at least 102 others injured in an Israeli military raid in Nablus. At least three of the victims were members of the Lion's Den and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another armed group. The raid, one of the deadliest in the West Bank in recent years, led to vows of revenge by the Palestinian groups. The incident came amid surging violence in the West Bank, a territory seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. Israel has kept its control over these lands, which the Palestinians claim for their future country.  ",Xinhua,2023-02-27 09:24

25,"Washington has money for wars overseas, not for railways at home -- critics","NEW YORK, Feb. 24 (Xinhua) -- The catastrophic toxic train derailment in Ohio has alerted Americans to the safety of their transport infrastructure, with repeated questions on social media asking why the government has money for wars around the world but not for railways at home. ""That was the biggest slap in the face,"" said Trent Conaway, the mayor of East Palestine when criticizing President Joe Biden for his surprise visit to Ukraine in a recent media interview. The mayor said he was furious when finding out President Biden was in Ukraine giving millions of U.S. dollars away to people over there instead of helping victims of the train derailment. ""That tells you right now he doesn't care about us,"" he complained. A train carrying toxic chemicals derailed on Feb. 3 in East Palestine, Ohio. Leaked chemicals exploded, burned and discharged poisonous pollutants to the air, water and soil. Related parties initially tried to hide up the seriousness of the accident, a reporter was even detained when trying to report the case. It was not widely known until two weeks later when videos of disastrous scenes of mushroom smoke, dead fish and sick animals were posted on social media. The tragedy was followed by more train derailments in Michigan, Texas and Nebraska. The serial train accidents caused people to worry about the poor conditions of the country's railways. A video showing a train ""dancing"" on seriously twisted rail tracks connecting Ohio and Indiana became viral on social media, and some followers said railways at their homes are no better than that. Stunned by videos showing the deteriorating conditions of railways, many followers wrote the United States really needs to renovate its infrastructure facilities instead of waging wars. Some satirized the government by saying that the country needs to redesign its railcar wheels to suit the twisted tracks. Due to worn-out railways, train accidents have become so common that national media would not report unless there are fatalities. Statistics from the U.S. Department of Transportation show that from 1990 to 2021, there have been 54,539 train derailment accidents, which average 1,704 per year. It's strange that there is money for wars but not for railways, and that's what the Americans are seeing. In 2023, the U.S. defence budget stands at a record high of 858 billion dollars, up by 8 percent from 2022. The United States spends more on national defense than the following nine countries combined, and it has also historically devoted a larger share of its economy to military expenditure than most countries in the world, including its key allies. Watson Institute of Brown University estimated in its ""Costs of War"" report that Washington had spent over 8 trillion dollars on the post-9/11 wars by 2022. While the United States paid for past wars by raising taxes and selling war bonds, the current wars have been paid for almost entirely with borrowed money, on which interest has to be paid. ""Even if war spending ceased immediately, so that expenses for overseas contingency operations and the Pentagon's base budget went to zero, spending on interest would continue to accrue, reaching at least several trillion dollars in over the next few decades,"" the report said. This sharply contrasts with the country's investment in domestic infrastructure. Federal decision-makers are extremely generous on military spending while stingy on civil spending. The American Society of Civil Engineering suggests in its 2021 infrastructure report card that roughly 2.59 trillion dollars will be needed in government funding over the next 10 years to address gaps in infrastructure. Continued underinvestment in infrastructure will ultimately cost the United States 10 trillion dollars in GDP, more than 3 million jobs and 2.4 trillion dollars in exports by 2039. In addition, Biden's infrastructure bill was ill-fated to be plagued by a record high of inflation, which slashed billions of dollars from its value. Ballooned cost has forced construction projects to be delayed or even canceled. The United States also needs money to solve numerous other problems at home. Hundreds of protesters gathered in Washington, D.C. on Sunday for the ""March Against the War Machine"" rally, calling on the U.S. government to end its military actions overseas and slash the Pentagon budget to address domestic issues. Former Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein in her speech called for slashing the Pentagon's enormous budget to help mitigate various domestic problems. She named a few of these problems: 70,000 people who die each year for lack of health insurance; a half million homeless people on any given night out in the street; 33 million marred in student debt; a 100 million in medical debt and 22 million impoverished children. ""Now we lead the world in making enemies, confusing defense with offense. Arming ourselves to the teeth, spending trillions of dollars to advance an aggressive empire through the promotion of war,"" said the former mayor of Cleveland Dennis Kucinich while criticizing the country's military-industrial complex.",Xinhua,2023-02-27 09:40
16,"Why U.S. overreaction to Chinese airship is ludicrous, dangerous?","BEIJING, Feb. 25 (Xinhua) -- Despite China's repeated explanation that the entry of a Chinese civilian unmanned airship into U.S. airspace was an entirely unintended, unexpected and isolated event caused by force majeure, the United States, without any evidence, slandered the airship as a ""spy balloon"" and abused force to shoot it down. Washington's ""unthinkable and hysterical action"" blatantly violated its obligations under the Chicago Convention and many basic principles of international law, as some U.S. politicians insisted on such absurd things only for their own political need at the expense of China-U.S. relations.  Weather balloons are regularly launched around the world for weather forecasting and scientific research. Every day, free-rising latex balloons are released from almost 900 locations worldwide, with nearly 1,000 balloons gathering daily observations that provide input in real-time, the UN World Meteorological Organization counted. However, in the first two weeks of February, U.S. fighter jets shot down four objects flying over North America, including the Chinese civilian balloon that the Pentagon said ""does not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground,"" or a significant risk of intelligence collection. U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday also admitted the other three objects were ""most likely tied to private companies, recreation or research institutions."" ""A lot of balloons are flying over the Earth every day. Does the U.S. want to shoot them all down?"" senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi raised the question on the sidelines of the 59th Munich Security Conference. Washington's drastic reaction to the weather balloon not only goes against scientific common sense, but also violates customary international practice and conventions. Above all, any international dispute shall be settled by peaceful means so that international peace, security and justice are not endangered, according to the UN Charter. Based on general principles of international law, in the circumstances of force majeure, distress and necessity, aircraft unauthorized to enter other countries' airspace shall be exempt of legal liability. Since last year, U.S. balloons have illegally flown over China's airspace more than 10 times without the approval of relevant authorities. But China handled those illegal flights in a calm and professional manner. That has demonstrated Beijing's respect for international law and sincerity in properly managing China-U.S. relations. As far as the ""stray balloon"" is concerned, China has clearly asked the U.S. side to properly handle the matter in a calm, professional and restrained manner, whereas the United States used ""the most advanced U.S. weapons systems"" -- as depicted by The Washington Post -- to eliminate the object. Clearly, Washington has resorted again to double standards. In 2016, China seized an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) -- later claimed by the Pentagon -- in the South China Sea to prevent it from harming navigational and personnel safety of passing ships. The U.S. Defense Department called on China to ""return our UUV immediately and to comply with all of its obligations under international law."" Its urge stands in sharp contrast with its downing of the four civilian aerial objects.  The United States, as a superpower of surveillance, has a long history of sending surveillance balloons and blimps beyond its borders to gather intelligence. That helps explain why the ill-grounded ""spy balloon"" narrative can raise mass hysteria in U.S. media and political community. Before the Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft and spy satellites came into service, the U.S. Air Force had developed reconnaissance balloon programs known as WS-119L and WS-461L for the mission of collecting intelligence over Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union between the late 1950s and early 1960s. Nowadays, as the center of gravity for global Internet and intelligence activity, the United States has further consolidated its privileged position to monitor. Among the countries it snoops on is China, which has been harassed by U.S. spy devices multiple times over the past few years. The Chinese Foreign Ministry confirmed in June 2022 that the United States has deployed many military aircraft and warships in the South China Sea on a regular basis and its reconnaissance aircraft have electronically impersonated civil aircraft of other countries there time and again. The ministry said, citing statistics from institutions with professional knowledge, that the number of the U.S. close-in military reconnaissance missions against China has more than doubled compared with a decade ago. In September last year, China's National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center and cybersecurity company 360 respectively released investigation reports on the attacks on China's Northwestern Polytechnical University from the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), which showed that the agency's Tailored Access Operations unit mounted hundreds of thousands malicious cyberattacks targeting Chinese objectives. Permeating through every part of the world, the U.S. surveillance network also targets Washington's allies. In May 2021, Denmark's national broadcaster DR News reported that the Danish Defense Intelligence Service had given the NSA open Internet access to spy on targeted heads of state, as well as Scandinavian leaders, top politicians, and high-ranking officials in Germany, Sweden, Norway and France, including then German Chancellor Angela Merkel. That was not unfamiliar to European leaders. In 2013, former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed that Washington had been spying on the email and cell phone communications of as many as 35 world leaders. Snowden also disclosed that a U.S. surveillance program codenamed Stateroom ordered the installment of secret intelligence equipment in some 100 foreign diplomatic embassies and consulates in other countries for spying. ""Washington is losing its moral ground,"" the German magazine Focus once quoted an expert on foreign policy as saying. With its global surveillance network, ""the United States itself is the true eavesdropper,"" Focus said, though the country prefers to frame itself as a victim of spying.",Xinhua,2023-02-27 09:43
17,"14 killed, over 50 injured after truck hits parked buses in India's Madhya Pradesh","NEW DELHI, Feb. 25 (Xinhua) -- At least 14 people were killed and over 50 others injured when a moving truck hit three buses parked on the roadside in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, police said Saturday. The accident took place late Friday night in Sidhi district, about 610 km northeast of Bhopal, the capital city of Madhya Pradesh. According to the police, a cement-laden truck lost control after one of its tyres burst and hit three buses parked on the side of a road, leaving at least eight people dead on the spot while six others succumbed during treatment. ""So far 14 deaths have been confirmed in the accident and 56 people were injured,"" a senior police official in Mukesh Srivastava told the media. The police said a majority of the injured people were undergoing treatment at Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in the adjacent Rewa district. According to officials, the victims had gone to attend a rally addressed by India's federal home minister Amit Shah and were returning to their homes. An investigation has been ordered to ascertain the cause of the accident. Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has announced a compensation of 12,060 U.S. dollars to each family that lost a member in the accident. Deadly road accidents are common in India due to overloading, bad condition of roads and reckless driving. Around 150,000 people are killed every year in about half a million road accidents across India, officials said.",Xinhua,2023-02-27 10:12
18,Naxals kill 3 policemen in India's Chhattisgarh gunfight,"NEW DELHI, Feb. 25 (Xinhua) -- Three policemen were killed and two others wounded Saturday in a fierce gunfight with Naxals in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, police said. The gunfight broke out between the Naxals and a contingent of the police's District Reserve Guard (DRG) at Jagargunda area in Sukma district, about 515 km south of Raipur, the capital city of Chhattisgarh. ""This morning a group of Naxalites ambushed a contingent of DRG in Jagargunda forests, triggering a gunfight. Three policemen were killed and two others wounded in the stand-off,"" a police official said. ""The wounded policemen were immediately removed to a hospital."" Following the attack, contingents of police and paramilitary were rushed to the area to carry out searches for the attackers. On Monday, Naxals killed two policemen in the Rajnandgaon district in the state. Currently, Naxals are active across the central and eastern parts of India. India's former prime minister Manmohan Singh once termed the Naxalite movement as India's ""greatest internal security challenge."" The insurgency reportedly has claimed hundreds of lives besides rendering thousands of poor inhabitants homeless.",Xinhua,2023-02-27 10:18
19,The investigation of the Nord Stream explosions is a high global priority,"On February 21, the UN Security Council held a public meeting on the Nord Stream Pipeline Destruction and its follow-up investigation. I made a video speech at the meeting. The destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines on September 26, 2022 constitutes an act of international terrorism and represents a threat to the peace. It is the responsibility of the UN Security Council to take up the question of who might have carried out the act, in order to bring the perpetrator to international justice, to pursue compensation for the damaged parties, and to prevent future such actions. The consequences of the destruction of Nord Stream 2 are enormous. They include not only the vast economic losses related to the pipelines themselves, but also the heightened threat to transboundary infrastructure of all kinds: submarine internet cables, international pipelines for gas and hydrogen, transboundary power transmission, offshore wind farms, and more. The global transformation to green energy will require considerable transboundary infrastructure, including in international waters. Countries need to have full confidence that their infrastructure will not be destroyed by third parties. Some European countries have recently expressed concern over the safety of their offshore infrastructure. For all of these reasons, the investigation by the UN Security Council of the Nord Stream explosions is a high global priority. The destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines required a very high degree of planning, expertise, and technological capacity. The Nord Stream 2 pipelines are a marvel of engineering. Each section of pipe is rolled steel of over 4 cm thickness, and with a pipeline internal diameter of 1.15 meters. The pipe is encased in concrete of 10.9 cm thickness. The weight of each section of concrete-encased pipe is 24 metric tons. The Nord Stream pipelines contain around 200,000 pipes. The pipelines sit on the sea floor. Destroying a pipeline of heavy rolled steel, encased in concrete, at the depth of 70-90 meters, requires highly advanced technologies for transportation of the explosives, diving to install the explosives, and detonation. To do so undetected, in the exclusive economic zones of Denmark and Sweden, adds greatly to the complexity of the operation. As a number of senior officials have confirmed, an action of this sort must have been carried out by a state-level actor. Only a handful of state-level actors have both the technical capacity and access to the Baltic Sea to have carried out this action. A recent report by the Washington Post revealed that the intelligence agencies of the NATO countries have privately concluded that there is no evidence whatsoever that Russia carried out this action. This also comports with the fact that Russia had no obvious motive to carry out this act of terrorism on its own critical infrastructure. Indeed, Russia is likely to bear considerable expenses to repair the pipelines. Three countries have reportedly carried out investigations of the Nord Stream terrorism: Denmark, Germany, and Sweden. These countries presumably know much about the circumstances of the terrorist attack. Sweden, in particular, which its divers investigated the crime scene. Yet Sweden has kept the results of its investigation secret from the rest of the world. Sweden has refused to share its findings with Russia, and turned down a joint investigation with Denmark and Germany. In the interest of global peace, the UN Security Council should require these countries to immediately turn over the results of their investigations to the UN Security Council. There is only one detailed account to date of the Nord Stream destruction, the one recently put forward by investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, ostensibly based on information leaked to Hersh by an unnamed source. Hersh attributes the Nord Stream destruction to a decision ordered by US President Joe Biden and carried out by US agents in a covert operation that Hersh describes in detail. The White House has described Hersh’s account as “completely and utterly false,” but did not offer any information contradicting Hersh’s account and did not offer any alternative explanation. Senior US officials made statements before and after the Nord Stream destruction that showed the US animus towards the pipelines. In January 2022, Under-Secretary of State Victoria Nuland tweeted, “If Russia invades Ukraine, one way or another, Nord Stream 2 will not move forward.” On February 7, President Biden said, ""If Russia invades... again, then there will be longer Nord Stream 2. We will bring an end to it."" When asked by the reporter how he would do that, he responded, ""I promise you we will be able to do it."" On September 30, 2022 immediately following the terrorist attack on the pipeline, Secretary of State Antony Blinken declared that the destruction of the pipeline is “also a tremendous opportunity. It’s a tremendous opportunity to once and for all remove the dependence on Russian energy”. In January 2023, Under-Secretary Nuland declared to Senator Ted Cruz, ""I am, and I think the administration is, very gratified to know that Nord Stream 2 is now, as you like to say, a hunk of metal at the bottom of the sea."" Such language is not at all appropriate in the face of international terrorism. I hope that the US together with all other Security Council members will condemn this heinous act of international terrorism and join together in an urgent UNSC-led investigation of this international crime in order to determine the truth. The truth is not yet known by the world, but it is knowable. More than ever, the world depends on the UN Security Council to do its work to stop war. The world will be safe only when the permanent members work together diplomatically to solve global crises. The UN Security Council provides the unique global venue for that peace-affirming work. More than ever, we need a healthy, functioning UN Security Council carrying out the mission assigned to it by the UN Charter. A UN Security Council objective investigation of the Nord Stream terrorism, in which all countries contribute what they know, is important for the global confidence in this body and most importantly, for global peace and sustainable development.

21,Truck crashes involving hazardous chemicals cause more accidents in U.S.: scholar,"SYDNEY, Feb. 25 (Xinhua) -- Truck crashes when transporting hazardous chemicals cause more accidents, deaths and damage than rail transportation in the United States, a scholar has said. The derailment of the freight train carrying chemicals in the U.S. state of Ohio earlier this month has made headlines recently. While truck incidents involving hazardous materials don't look as dramatic as train derailments, they represent more fatalities and property damage, and there are thousands more of them every year, professor from the University of Dayton Michael F. Gorman has said in an article published by the media network the Conversation on Wednesday. ""Today, trucks carry the largest percentage of hazardous materials shipped in the U.S. -- about twice as much as trains when measured in ton-miles, according to the Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics' latest data for 2017,"" Gorman wrote. According to the article, truck-related hazardous materials incidents caused over 16 times more fatalities from 1975 to 2021 -- 380 for truck, compared with 23 for rail. The difference is more pronounced in the last decade when U.S. rail transportation of hazardous materials caused zero fatalities and truck incidents were responsible for 83, it said.",Xinhua,2023-02-27 10:39
33,"Feature: Amid emotional aftermath, Turkish quake survivors need mental health aid","ANKARA, Feb. 25 (Xinhua) -- As survivors of the earthquakes in Türkiye are facing devastating trauma and loss, psychological support is essential for healing after a disaster of such proportions that has affected millions, experts said. Tens of thousands of people died in the massive earthquakes striking Türkiye and Syria on Feb. 6. The Turkish Enterprise and Business Confederation put the cost of the disaster in the country at 84.1 billion dollars, but the mental health consequences remain incalculable. ""The most vulnerable groups are women, children, people with prior mental health disorders, and people with disabilities,"" said Ankara-based psychiatrist Hande Karakilic Ucer. Not to mention the children who have lost both parents to the disaster and been separated from their extended families, she told Xinhua. Research conducted by the Turkish Health Ministry following the 1999 earthquake showed that children and adolescents are more prone to developing mental health problems than adults are when they have been exposed to traumatic natural disasters. People around children should not act as if nothing happened, Ucer noted, referring to the danger of victims shutting down their emotions in face of the trauma. ""We have to be open with children and explain this disaster to them in a language that they can comprehend,"" she said, adding that ""play therapy"" and establishing a daily routine are essential for children to survive a grieving period. In Türkiye, the 7.7 and 7.6 magnitude quakes have claimed 44,218 lives, according to the latest statistics on Saturday. Expert psychologists and psychiatrists have been dispatched to the quake-hit regions to help residents cope with the profound impact. Experts also recommend survivors limit their consumption of bad news and disturbing social media posts over the catastrophe. ""Media exposure can influence our behavior following a natural disaster, and trigger mental disorders,"" Ucer said. Seda Ozcan is a 27-year-old earthquake survivor from Antakya, a city near the Syrian border leveled by the earthquakes. Since the disaster, she is experiencing debilitating anxiety attacks that keep her up at night and from going through normal daily tasks. ""It's not the earthquakes itself, it's the whole situation we are facing, homelessness, concerns about the future, it's hard,"" she told Xinhua in Ankara, to which her family has been evacuated. Offering psychological support to those impacted by a disaster involves a long process, health professionals say, as tiding through stages of trauma takes time. The vastness of the quake-hit zone spanning over 10 Turkish provinces home to 13.5 million people adds to the challenge. ""In six months, survivors will enter the disappointment phase, and then will they face the bitter reality of things, ultimately followed by the healing phase,"" Ucer said.",Xinhua,2023-02-27 11:01
42,Policeman killed in IED blast in India's Chhattisgarh state,"NEW DELHI, Feb. 26 (Xinhua) -- A policeman was killed Sunday after an improvised explosive device (IED) planted by the Naxal rebels went off in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, police said. The blast occurred in the Orchha area of Narayanpur district, about 300 km south of Raipur, the capital city of Chhattisgarh. According to officials, the slain policeman belonged to Chhattisgarh Armed Force (CAF). ""This morning a head constable of the CAF was killed after a pressure IED planted by Naxalites went off near Batum village in Narayanpur district,"" a police officer said. The policeman was part of a patrolling contingent, who reportedly had gone into the area after receiving information that Naxalites have put up banners there. ""The policeman inadvertently stepped over a pressure IED, causing its blast which resulted in his death,"" the police officer said. On Saturday, three policemen were killed and two others wounded in a fierce gunfight with Naxals in Sukma district. On Monday, Naxals killed two policemen in Bortalab area of Rajnandgaon district of the state. Currently, the Naxal insurgents are active across the central and eastern parts of India. India's former prime minister Manmohan Singh once termed the Naxalite movement as India's ""greatest internal security challenge.""

Last week, the Southeast Asian nation confirmed two human infections with H5N1 bird flu, the first since 2014, the statement said. It added that the first case involved an 11-year-old girl from southeastern Prey Veng province, who died of the virus on Feb. 22, and her 49-year-old father was tested positive for the virus a day later and is currently in isolation at the Prey Veng Provincial Referral Hospital. Eleven others, who were in close contacts with the deceased girl, tested negative for the H5N1 virus, the statement said. Almost all H5N1 infection cases in people have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1 virus-contaminated environments, it added. ""Based on evidence so far, the virus does not infect humans easily and spreads from person-to-person appears to be unusual,"" the statement said. ""Based on available information so far, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low."" WHO representative to Cambodia Li Ailan praised the kingdom for its swift response to the H5N1 outbreak. ""These are the first two human cases of H5N1 reported from Cambodia since 2014,"" she said.

37,Norway attracted to U.S. sabotage project of Nord Stream pipelines: Modern Diplomacy,"   NEW YORK, Feb. 27 (Xinhua) -- Norway was attracted to the United States' sabotage project like a fly to the honeypot, since it stood to gain fabulously in financial terms if it helped the U.S. military to destroy Nord Stream pipelines near Danish waters, and replace Russia as Germany's principal source of piped natural gas, said an article published on the Modern Diplomacy website on Saturday, citing former Indian diplomat and prominent international observer M.K. Bhadrakumar. Seymour Hersh, an investigative journalist who disclosed in a report earlier this month details of the U.S. sabotage plan, has explained to the German newspaper Berliner Zeitung that Norway was particularly interested in successfully pulling off the plot against the Nord Stream pipelines, according to the article. In Hersh's words, ""Norway was interested in income growth, and hence in increasing the volume of its energy supplies to the EU, to the same Germany. And what do we see after the mission? Norway has made it. It's (energy) exports grew against the backdrop of significant hostility towards Russia,"" wrote Bhadrakumar. Ironically, at a joint press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in August 2022, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store claimed that ""Norway delivers as much gas as possible to Germany,"" he noted. ""Of course, what he didn't tell Scholz was that Norway was about to execute a project to transform Germany, Europe's largest consumer of natural gas, as a captive market for it very soon. Actually, Norway blew up the Nord Stream pipelines only a month later on September 22,"" added Bhadrakumar.",Xinhua,2023-02-28 08:22
35,"1 killed, 12 injured after at least 7 tornadoes hit U.S. Oklahoma","HOUSTON, Feb. 27 (Xinhua)-- One person was killed and 12 people injured after at least seven confirmed tornadoes hit the south central U.S. state of Oklahoma on late Sunday and early Monday, which caused widespread damage to several towns and cities, authorities said on Monday. The dead was found in Cheyenne in the wake of severe storms, local media outlet KOCO reported on Monday. Several homes and a cemetery in the western Oklahoma town were damaged. None of the injuries are critical, KOCO reported. Video on social media showed that in the overnight tornadoes and high winds, roofs were ripped off, brick walls tumbled and an SUV was flipped onto the hood of another car. The severe storms knocked over numerous power lines, broke power poles, and caused thousands of outages across the state on Monday. At least two elementary schools were closed on Monday because of power outages, Norman Public Schools officials said. The National Weather Service (NWS) on Monday confirmed that at least seven tornadoes spun up across Oklahoma, resulting at least EF-2 damage at a few locations and that rating may increase. KOCO Meteorologist Damon Lane said the figure already makes this month the most active February for tornadoes in Oklahoma history while many more likely tornadoes are still to count. The previous record was six in 1975 and 2009. ""My heart goes out to the communities impacted by last night's severe weather; especially those hit hardest like Cheyenne and my hometown of Norman,"" Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt tweeted on Monday. The NWS said possible tornadoes also hit parts of neighboring states Kansas and Texas, causing injuries, damages and outages. More than 75,000 homes and businesses were without power in Oklahoma and Kansas early Monday, while high winds were blamed for nearly 15,000 power outages in Texas, according to the weather.com website.",Xinhua,2023-02-28 08:38
31,U.S. aid to Ukraine amounts to 50 bln USD since start of conflict,"KIEV, Feb. 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States has provided about 50 billion U.S. dollars in aid to Ukraine since the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reported Monday, citing visiting U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. ""In the field of security, economy, humanitarian and social support, we have already provided about 50 billion dollars in assistance,"" Yellen said after her meeting with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. In particular, the United States has provided 14 billion dollars to support the economic resilience of Ukraine, Yellen said, noting that it plans to allocate another 8 billion dollars for the same needs in the near future. For his part, Shmyhal said that in 2022, the United States was the top contributor of funds to the Ukrainian economy among foreign countries. According to estimates of the Ukrainian government, the country would need 38 billion dollars in financing, including from external sources, to cover its budget deficit this year.",Xinhua,2023-02-28 08:40
34,Italy migrant shipwreck death toll rises to 62,"   ROME, Feb. 27 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from Sunday's sinking of a migrant ship approaching the Italian shore rose to 62 on Monday, including 14 children, local media reported. Local authorities said that at least 80 people have been rescued after the overloaded vessel crashed against rocks early in the morning near the Calabrian coastal town of Crotone. Those rescued included three suspected smugglers, who have been detained by the Italian authorities, local media said. At least ten people are still unaccounted for, a spokesman for the Vigili del Fuoco, Italy's national fire and rescue brigade, told Xinhua on Monday. According to reports, the crowded ship had sailed from Türkiye last week headed for the southern Italian region of Calabria. During rough weather, the vessel is reported to have sunk after it crashed against rocks.   Most of the bodies were recovered from the beach, while others were found at sea. Most of those on board were reportedly refugees from Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif of Pakistan was cited by media on Monday as saying that over two dozen Pakistanis were believed to be among the people who drowned. Vigili del Fuoco said on Twitter that search efforts continued well into Monday, despite difficult conditions at sea that forced some of the rescue ships to return to port.",Xinhua,2023-02-28 08:42
2,"UK, EU reach new post-Brexit deal for N. Ireland","  LONDON, Feb. 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom (UK) and the European Union (EU) concluded on Monday a new post-Brexit trade arrangement for Northern Ireland. The agreement -- dubbed the ""Windsor Framework"" -- was struck over the Northern Ireland Protocol, aiming to ease the trading issues created by the Protocol. After months of negotiations, the deal was announced by UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen after their meeting in Windsor near London. ""I'm pleased to report that we have now made a decisive breakthrough,"" Sunak said at a joint press conference with von der Leyen. ""Together, we have changed the original Protocol and are today announcing the new Windsor Framework."" He said the agreement delivers the smooth flow of trade within the UK, as goods destined for Northern Ireland will travel through a new Green Lane, with a separate Red Lane for goods at risk of moving on into the EU. In the Green Lane, burdensome customs bureaucracy will be scrapped, meaning food retailers such as supermarkets and restaurants as well as wholesalers will no longer need hundreds of certificates for every lorry, Sunak told reporters. ""This means we have removed any sense of a border in the Irish Sea,"" he said. The two sides have also amended the legal text of the Protocol to ensure the country can make critical value-added tax and excise changes for the whole of the UK, ""for example on alcohol duty, meaning our reforms to cut the cost of a pint in the pub will now apply in Northern Ireland."" With a settlement on medicines, moreover, drugs approved for use by the UK's medicine regulator will be automatically available in every pharmacy and hospital in Northern Ireland. A new so-called ""Stormont Brake"" was also introduced. It will allow the elected Northern Ireland Assembly to stop EU goods laws that would have ""significant and lasting effects on everyday lives."" When pulled, ""the UK government will have a veto,"" the prime minister said. ""This gives Northern Ireland a powerful safeguard,"" he said. Many had called for Stormont, or the Northern Ireland Assembly, to have a say over these laws, he noted. ""But the Stormont Brake goes further and means that Stormont can in fact stop them from applying in Northern Ireland."" Sunak called the Windsor Framework a ""turning point"" for the people of Northern Ireland, saying it fixes the practical problems they face and preserves the balance of the Belfast Good Friday Agreement. Noting that this year will mark the 25th anniversary of the Belfast Agreement, von der Leyen said the new Windsor Framework is here to benefit people in Northern Ireland and support all communities celebrating peace on the island of Ireland. ""We were both genuinely committed to finding a practical solution for people and for all communities in Northern Ireland,"" the EU chief said. ""This new Framework will allow us to begin a new chapter."" Signed in 1998 following three decades of conflict, the landmark Belfast Agreement established a power-sharing system of government, including an Executive and Assembly. It underpins Northern Ireland's peace, constitutional settlement and institutions. A lengthy dispute over the Northern Ireland Protocol has recently posed a threat. Under the protocol, Northern Ireland was part of the British customs territory but subject to the EU's customs code, value-added tax rules and single market rules for goods. However, a de facto Irish Sea border was thus created between the British mainland and Northern Ireland, meaning goods transported to and from Northern Ireland were subject to border controls. Northern Ireland's pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party has demanded the removal or replacement of the protocol as a precondition for it to sit in the assembly and form a devolved government.

The earthquake's epicenter was located at the Yesilyurt district of Malatya province, which had already been struck by the powerful tremors on Feb. 6. A total of 25 buildings that had previously been damaged by the tremors earlier this month collapsed on Monday, the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) said. On Feb. 6, a magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck Türkiye's southern province of Kahramanmaras at 4:17 a.m. local time (0117 GMT), followed by a magnitude 6.4 quake a few minutes later in the country's southern province of Gaziantep and a magnitude 7.6 earthquake at 1:24 p.m. local time (1024 GMT) in the Kahramanmaras Province.

1,U.S. is averaging one chemical accident every two days: The Guardian,"LONDON, Feb. 27 (Xinhua) -- A Guardian analysis of data collected by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and by non-profit groups that track chemical accidents in the United States shows that accidental releases --through train derailments, truck crashes, pipeline ruptures or industrial plant leaks and spills -- are happening consistently across the country. In the first seven weeks of 2023 alone, there were more than 30 incidents recorded by the Coalition to Prevent Chemical Disasters, roughly one every day and a half, The Guardian said on Saturday. Last year the coalition recorded 188, up from 177 in 2021. The incidents logged by the coalition range widely in severity but each involves the accidental release of chemicals deemed to pose potential threats to human and environmental health, it said. The precise number of hazardous chemical incidents is hard to determine because the United States has multiple agencies involved in response, but the EPA told the Guardian that over the past 10 years, the agency has ""performed an average of 235 emergency response actions per year, including responses to discharges of hazardous chemicals or oil."" In all, roughly 200 million people are at regular risk, with many of them people of color, or otherwise disadvantaged communities, The Guardian quoted Mathy Stanislaus, who served as assistant administrator of the EPA's office of land and emergency management during the Obama administration, as saying. ""They live in daily fear of an accident,"" Stanislaus said. Though industry representatives say the rate of accidents is trending down, worker and community advocates disagree, claiming that incomplete data and delays in reporting incidents give a false sense of improvement, it said.",Xinhua,2023-02-28 10:48
8,Interview: Spanish expert blames U.S. for Nord Stream pipeline blast,"BARCELONA, Spain, Feb. 27 (Xinhua) -- ""I increasingly believe that the incident that led to the breaking of the gas pipeline was the result of an action by the United States,"" a Spanish political expert said on Monday, noting the aim of which was to break German dependence on Russian gas. Josep Puigsech, an expert on Russian affairs and professor of contemporary history at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, shared his thoughts with Xinhua about the Nord Stream pipeline incident that occurred in September last year. ""As there's a clear profit to be made by the United States and at the same time a strengthening of its geopolitical influence over Germany, and given the international dimension of the conflict, I'm increasingly convinced this was an action by the United States,"" he said. ""There were NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) operations in the Baltic in 2022 and a few months later this incident happened, so the general perception is that this was an action most likely had something to do with the NATO manoeuvers rather than with the Russian Federation,"" Puigsech said, dismissing initial reports that Russia was responsible for the incident. The professor insisted that the damage to the pipeline dealt a severe blow to Russia and to its relationship with Western Europe. ""What's clear is that the honeymoon between cheap Russian gas for the benefit of Germany and other Western states and Russia's exporting capacity that generated significant economic resources for the Russian state has been definitively broken,"" he said. According to Puigsech, the consequences of the Nord Stream incident are long-term: while increasing Germany's dependence on the U.S., the latter also forced Russia's energy out of Europe. And Russian energies would ""very possibly"" be reoriented to Asia. After leaks were reported in the Nord Stream pipelines, which were built to carry natural gas from Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea, Sweden and Denmark, in whose jurisdiction the leaks occurred, said the pipelines were deliberately sabotaged, although they did not say who was responsible for the attack. Since then, speculation that the United States may have been behind the explosions has grown, culminating this month in a report by veteran Pulitzer Prize-winning American investigative journalist, Seymour Hersh, which alleged that the bombing was carried out on the orders of the White House. The Joe Biden administration has denied the allegations, but Puigsech believes that the United States has the most to gain from the destruction of the pipelines, arguing that one of the most important benefits to the U.S. is it could sell the natural gas from fracking to Germany.",Xinhua,2023-02-28 10:50
9,"U.S. response to Chinese weather balloon ""bizarre military stunt"": Al Jazeera columnist","DOHA, Feb. 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. response to a Chinese weather balloon ignores its own track record of ""global surveillance and bombing,"" said an opinion piece published on the website of Al Jazeera. The U.S. shooting down the Chinese weather balloon in its airspace is a ""bizarre military stunt"" that has been performed on the world stage ""on purpose,"" columnist Belen Fernandez wrote in an article published on the website of Al Jazeera on Thursday. The U.S. reaction is ""pretty preposterous"" given its own ""stellar track record of surveilling everyone and everything in the world,"" including ""decades of particularly aggressive spying against China."" The United States faces many problems that are ""more existentially perilous than a balloon off the coast of South Carolina,"" such as the lack of a functioning healthcare or education system and mass shootings, wrote Fernandez. She added that the panic about the Chinese balloon also ""discounts all the literal ariel terror that is made in the U.S. -- from bombing and strafing Afghanistan and Iraq to saturating the heavens with armed drones."" The ""made-in-U.S. panic"" fuels ""an atmosphere of bellicose Sinophobia,"" she added. On Feb. 4, the United States shot down a Chinese weather balloon that had blown off course with a 400,000-U.S. dollar missile. China has rejected the U.S. claim that it was a ""spy balloon"" and said the entry of the Chinese civilian weather balloon was an entirely unintended, unexpected and isolated event caused by force majeure.",Xinhua,2023-02-28 10:52
10,Residents near Ohio train derailment diagnosed with ailments associated with chemical exposure: U.S. media,"NEW YORK, Feb. 27 (Xinhua) -- Residents and workers near the site in the U.S. state of Ohio where a train carrying hazardous chemicals derailed early this month have been diagnosed with bronchitis and other conditions that doctors and nurses suspect are linked to chemical exposure, according to a NBC News report. Deborah Weese, a nurse practitioner at Quickmed Columbiana, one of the closest urgent care clinics to East Palestine, Ohio, was quoted as saying that she has listed ""exposure to potentially hazardous chemicals"" as a possible cause of bronchitis or other ailments for patients who live or work near the crash site. Bronchitis is characterized by inflamed airways that often lead to coughing and wheezing. It is usually caused by a virus, but chemical bronchitis is caused by inhaling chemical irritants, according to Dr. John Balmes, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and spokesman for the American Lung Association. Balmes said the severity depends on the amount of chemicals inhaled and whether people have pre-existing conditions like asthma. Most people see their symptoms resolve within a few weeks to a couple months, and long-term effects are unlikely except in high-risk patients, according to Balmes. Apart from breathing issues, some local residents have reported headaches, nausea and rashes, the report said. These can be symptoms of chemical exposure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has sent a team to East Palestine to interview residents and investigate potential health issues starting on Monday.",Xinhua,2023-02-28 10:54

The government allows its citizens to legally own 390 million guns, and ""that is why all such incidents are happening,"" said the report. According to the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 4,300 children lost their lives to gunshots in 2020, 33.4 percent more than 2019. Traffic accidents have been the leading cause of death for young Americans in recent years, and after that there is death by gun attack. ""The use of guns continues to increase due to the lack of control over firearms,"" it said. ""Yet neither Republican nor Democrat administrations have made major changes to gun laws,"" it noted. ""Gun violence has turned into a human rights crisis in the United States. More than 39,000 men, women and children are killed by guns in the United States each year as a result of easy and widespread access to firearms for individuals and families, and lax regulations,"" added the report.",Xinhua,2023-02-28 10:56
4,Long COVID-disabled Americans face broken Social Security disability process: CNN,"   NEW YORK, Feb. 27 (Xinhua) -- Up to 23 million Americans are estimated to be living with post-acute sequelae SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), the medical name often given to COVID-19 symptoms that last or evolve after an initial infection, reported CNN on Saturday. The chronic condition can include symptoms from memory loss and extreme fatigue to muscle weakness and musculoskeletal pain. Patients can struggle for months and even years, and many cannot work during that period. ""Pandemic issues and budget cuts at the Social Security Administration, which handles SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance) claims, have resulted in the lowest staffing levels in 25 years, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Hersh explained that Biden had ordered the pipeline blasts, and called Washington's attempts to deny involvement in the incident complete ""fiction."" The reporter believes that the U.S. president had lied to the public, claiming that he hadn't authorized the attacks. According to Hersh, the true intention of the sabotage was to ensure that Europe would keep supporting NATO and ramping up its weapons supplies to Ukraine, to continue fighting what he called ""a clear proxy war against Russia.""

12,UN body seeks new global consensus on safeguarding human rights,"GENEVA, Feb. 27 (Xinhua) -- United Nations (UN) human rights chief Volker Turk on Monday deplored the weaponization of human rights in the context of geopolitical shifts. Turk, who took office as the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights last October, was speaking at the opening of the 52nd regular session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. He called for a ""new world-wide consensus on human rights"", arguing that it is a question of survival that nations and communities should arrive at a common understanding. ""Our institutions -- which exist to advance all civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, on an equal footing, as well as the right to development and the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment -- are in a unique position to rebuild this shared respect for each other's dignity,"" he said. He urged all the UN member states to overcome their differences through solidarity and genuine dialogue, working across geopolitical divides with a clear vision to advance the needs of every country and the rights of all. ""We can rise above the fray, and use human rights, not as a weapon in the context of geopolitical shifts -- not as a nice-to-have for sunny days in the future -- but as what it is and was always meant to be: a solution to help us get out of the harms that are destroying our world,"" he said. The event, which will last for five and a half weeks, kicked off with a minute's silence in honor of the victims of the recent earthquake in Türkiye and Syria. During the first four days, 146 dignitaries will deliver their interventions, with most of them due to appear in person. Vaclav Balek, president of the UN Human Rights Council, appealed to all participants to engage in open and frank discussions, enabled by a constructive and cooperative atmosphere. ""All delegations and participants should commit to these principles,"" he said. Csaba Korosi, currently serving as President of the 77th UN General Assembly, said at Monday's session that the UN Human Rights Council, like the General Assembly, is ""at a crossroads."" ""Will it go about business as usual, compounding the crisis of trust in multilateralism? Or will it translate the political consensus on the need to cooperate into transformative solutions?"" he asked. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that in July, together with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, he will launch a new Agenda for Protection, which will seek to strengthen support to member states to protect people and their rights, both in times of peace and in times of crisis and conflict. ""Human rights are not a luxury that can be left until we find a solution to the world's other problems.

15,"Racism against Asian Americans -- a long, ugly chapter in U.S. history","NEW YORK, Feb. 27 (Xinhua) -- On the morning of Feb. 13, 2022, 35-year-old Christina Yuna Lee was found dead in her bathroom stabbed 40 times after a man, Assamad Nash, silently followed her up six flights of stairs into her lower Manhattan apartment, only because of her Asian descent. Following the random yet violent murder, mourners placed flowers, candles, photos and cardboard signs condemning anti-Asian hatred outside the residential building. However, the makeshift memorial for the Korean-American victim was repeatedly vandalized. Every attack on the memorial is pretty much anti-Asian and ""it is very scary now,"" said Brian Chin, Lee's former landlord, whose family came to the United States from China six decades ago. ""They're doing it with hate."" Lee's tragedy and similar racist incidents are just the tip of the iceberg regarding anti-Asian racism in the country. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, some U.S. politicians have blatantly spread and hyped up conspiracy theories to shift the blame for their failed response to the contagion onto Asian Americans, causing a surge in anti-Asian hate crimes. Over three years into the pandemic, the U.S. government, turning a blind eye to science and basic facts, recently introduced discriminatory restrictions targeting tourists arriving from China, raising concerns about further aggravating the situation.  In the past few years, shocking racist attacks against Asian Americans have occurred frequently in the United States. For instance, on July 14, 2020, in New York City, an 89-year-old Chinese American woman was slapped in the face by two male strangers on the street, and when she tried to escape, the men set her clothes on fire from behind. On Aug. 30, 2021, an elderly Filipino woman was pushed down the stairs by a white man in Rego Park Subway Station in Queens, New York, resulting in her sustaining serious facial and physical injuries. Jenny H., in her 60s, has been living in San Francisco for more than 30 years. She didn't give her full name to Xinhua for fear that she would again become a target of racial assaults after the interview. The lady used to like going outside, doing voluntary work, talking to strangers on buses ... though such a life is now nothing but a distant memory to her. In 2020, she had her bones broken in a subway station after someone violently pushed her to the ground. Furthermore, she was once hit in the face by a bus passenger, leaving permanent damage to her eye. Nowadays, she must go to the hospital every three months for a medical checkup, but other than that, she doesn't dare to go outside amid the spike in Asiaphobia. Some U.S. politicians bear a great deal of responsibility for this situation, as they tend to scapegoat the Asian community and deliberately stoke xenophobia and racism to cover up their own incompetencies in solving domestic political problems. Haipei Shue, president of United Chinese Americans, an Asian American advocacy group, told Xinhua that the United States is regressing in the fight against racial discrimination at an alarming rate. In 2021, hate crimes against Asian Americans rose sharply by 339 percent compared with 2020, showed data from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, a U.S. nonpartisan research and policy center. Between March 2020 and December 2021, nearly 11,000 hate incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders were reported to the national coalition Stop Asian American and Pacific Islander Hate. One in five incidents occurred as an attacker attributed the impact of COVID-19, income volatility and other problems to Asians and Asian Americans. In March 2021, Robert Aaron Long, a 21-year-old white man, opened fire in three Asian Massage shops and spas in Atlanta with a gun, killing eight people, including six Asian women. When addressing a speech at Emory University, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said, ""Racism is real in America, and it has always been there. Xenophobia is real in America, and always has been."" ""Asian Americans have been attacked and scapegoated,"" she said. ""People with the biggest pulpits spreading this kind of hate."" In May 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden signed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. Yet a study published by Pew Research Center in May 2022 showed about six in ten Asian adults see violence against Asian Americans in the United States as increasing, while 19 percent say there has not been much change.  In June 2005, construction crews unearthed bones and artifacts while widening a road to make room for the Gold Line rail extension to east Los Angeles. Archaeologists later found 174 burial sites, some dating back as far as the 1880s. A few had headstones with engravings in Chinese, and some contained artifacts such as teapots and jade jewelry. Historians believe the site was once a potter's field, a cemetery for the poor, that was lost to developments in the 1920s. Many Chinese were buried there because they were not allowed to be buried among whites in the nearby Evergreen Cemetery. In 1863, the United States embarked on the Pacific Railroad project, North America's very first transcontinental railroad, and recruited some 12,000 Chinese workers to construct the project under extremely dangerous and challenging conditions. Over five consecutive months between late 1865 and early 1866, more than 3,000 Chinese railway workers were killed in avalanches caused by frequent snowstorms. The victims, in ragged clothes and barefoot, were not discovered until the snow melted months later. Despite their historical contributions to U.S. development, Chinese Americans have become victims of social repulsion and racial violence. In 1854, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Asian Americans were not and could not be citizens in a case, and such restrictions on Asian Americans' access to citizenship were not finally abolished until around the 1940s. The earliest record of organized violence against Asian Americans was in 1871, when a group of whites rushed into an Asian community near Los Angeles' Chinatown, shooting and hanging 21 Chinese Americans to death, burning down the community, and driving the residents out of the city. The severe prejudice against Asian Americans eventually led to the prohibition of Chinese immigrants in the United States with the enactment of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which stayed in force until 1943. The sin of racial discrimination is deeply rooted in U.S. history, with the Chinese Exclusion Act being one epitome, said Shue, head of the above-mentioned Chinese Americans advocacy group. Targeting and suppressing a specific ethnic group, the law has caused irreparable harm to Chinese Americans. On the night of June 19, 1982, 27-year-old Chinese American Vincent Chin was beaten to death by two white autoworkers in the U.S. city of Detroit at a time when local politicians, union leaders and auto executives blamed Japan for the decline of the U.S. auto industry, and Chin was mistaken as a Japanese. The two criminals were eventually fined 3,000 U.S. dollars and sentenced to probation. Charles Kaufman, a former U.S. judge who ruled the case, said, ""These weren't the kind of men you send to jail ... You don't make the punishment fit the crime; you make the punishment fit the criminal."" ""In 1982, Mr. Chin was made into a scapegoat not only for Japanese autoworkers and executives but also a deteriorating way of life for those once solidly in the middle class but quickly falling out of it,"" wrote David Shih, a professor of English at the University of Wisconsin, in an opinion piece published in The New York Times last year. Today, Asian Americans are also ""the scapegoat for a fading sense of well-being in a market-driven and hypercompetitive society,"" Shih said.  Earlier this year, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention instituted discriminatory entry restrictions against China, requiring travelers flying from China to the United States to provide negative COVID-19 test results taken within two days of departure or proof of recovery from the disease within 90 days. Jonathan Reiner, a professor of medicine and surgery at the George Washington University School, tweeted in response that ""The U.S. plan to require travelers from China to be tested prior to departure is mostly performative,"" adding ""The Chinese testing is just a gesture."" The policy itself isn't the main concern, but rather the larger anti-Chinese environment under which the rule has been imposed. And it's an issue that extends beyond the pandemic, said John C. Yang, president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice. ""We are concerned that that is another place where it will be an excuse to China-bash and thereby cause a backlash against Chinese Americans and the Asian American community as a whole,"" Yang said. Just about a week after the entry restrictions took effect, an 18-year-old Asian woman at Indiana University Bloomington was attacked and stabbed several times in the head by a 56-year-old white woman with a knife on a bus. The suspect told police that her target was ""Chinese"" and it ""would be one less person to blow up our country."" Huping Ling, a renowned U.S. historian focusing on Asian American studies, said xenophobic violence against Asian Americans has deep historical roots in the United States. She pointed out in her book ""Asian American History and Culture: An Encyclopedia"" that driven by racially biased and discriminatory laws and policies, xenophobic violence began with the first wave of Chinese immigrants to the United States and has been repeated ever since. Li Minjin, an Asian-American writer who grew up in Queens, New York, said in an interview with American media that no matter how educated Asian Americans are or how safe their communities are, they are likely to encounter insults and attacks, and may even be killed. This is the historical result of the long-term persecution of the Asian community. Some scholars argue that unlike discrimination against African Americans, discrimination against Asian Americans in U.S. society has been xenophobic historically. At its core, from its psychological roots, is a view of ""alienating Asians permanently."" Chinese-American historian Erika Lee wrote in the book ""The Making of Asian America: A History"" that while the discriminatory laws of the past have been repealed, Asian Americans have not achieved full equality in American society. Many Asians settled in the United States generations ago but are still considered outsiders, which has allowed discrimination against them and made them the target of violence, murder, and hate crimes. Chinese-American writer and journalist Katherine Chen admitted in a review article that for many years, she has felt like an outsider in the United States, with no choice but to alienate her ethnic traditions and culture. Asian-American groups were beaten, stabbed, or pushed onto subway tracks, but ""what happened to us was not noticed among our peers, nor in history textbooks and civil rights speeches,"" she said. In a broader sense, anti-Asian racism is one manifestation of systemic racial discrimination in the United States. Like African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans and other ethnic minorities, Asians have all been objects of discrimination and oppression by ""white supremacists"" in the United States for a long time. They are also the victims of racial hatred and antagonism incited by U.S. politicians who are acting out of their own interests. ""We are a nation of immigrants with a history of discrimination and exploitation of minority groups. We are still learning from the mistakes of the past. Asian Americans have contributed mightily to the success of the United States, but there is still much work to be done to treat Asian Americans as Americans,"" said Committee of 100 President Huang Zhengyu. The fight against racist words and actions of certain politicians and leaders towards the Asian American community as well as long-held stereotypes is staged on a daily basis, Huang added. Zhang Yunhan, a tea shop owner in Washington, D.C., was subject to anti-Asian attack, and he believes that the surge in hate crimes in the wake of COVID-19 is a culmination of the racism that has plagued the United States for centuries. ""It's not going to go away. It's a deep-rooted problem,"" he told Xinhua.",Xinhua,2023-02-28 14:40

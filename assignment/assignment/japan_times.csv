370,The ‘red wave’ washout: How skewed polls fed a false U.S. election narrative,"U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat, had consistently won re-election by healthy margins in her three decades representing Washington state. This year seemed no different: By midsummer, polls showed her cruising to victory over a Republican newcomer, Tiffany Smiley, by as much as 20 percentage points. So when a survey in late September by the Republican-leaning Trafalgar Group showed Murray clinging to a lead of just 2 points, it seemed like an aberration. But in October, two more Republican-leaning polls put Murray barely ahead, and a third said the race was a dead heat. As the red and blue trend lines of the closely watched RealClearPolitics average for the contest drew closer together, news organizations reported that Murray was suddenly in a fight for her political survival. Warning lights flashed in Democratic war rooms. If Murray was in trouble, no Democrat was safe.","Jim Rutenberg, The New York Times",2023-01-01

Many were ready to set aside pinched budgets and a virus that is increasingly forgotten but not gone, and embrace a party atmosphere on New Year’s Eve after a few pandemic-dampened years. In New York, confetti rained down on crowds after the famous ball drop in Times Square, a tradition that dates back to 1907, with visitors from across the world waiting for hours in the chilly rain to take part.",AFP-JIJI,2023-01-01

The Interior Department approved the project anyway. The warnings were delivered in unpublished correspondence weeks before Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management authorized the 12-turbine South Fork plan in November 2021. And they serve to underscore the potential ecological consequences and environmental tradeoff of a coming offshore wind boom along the U.S. East Coast. President Joe Biden wants the U.S. to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by the end of the decade.","Jennifer A. Dlouhy, Bloomberg",2023-01-02

The unfolding trend known as “near-shoring” has drawn the attention of no less than Walmart, the global retail empire with headquarters in Arkansas. Early in 2022, when Walmart needed $1 million of company uniforms — more than 50,000 in one order — it bought them not from its usual suppliers in China but from Preslow, a family-run apparel business in Mexico.","Peter S.

Footage from the war-themed Arma 3 video game, often marked “live” or “breaking news” to make it appear genuine, has been used repeatedly in recent months in fake videos about the Russian offensive in Ukraine. The frequency and ease with which gaming footage is mistaken as real, even by some media broadcasters, and shared as authentic news on social media highlights what researchers call its serious potential to spread misinformation.","Anuj Chopra, AFP-Jiji",2023-01-02

In a speech to Congress after officially taking the reins of Latin America’s biggest country, the leftist said democracy was the true winner of the October presidential vote, when he ousted Bolsonaro in the most fraught election for a generation. Bolsonaro, who left Brazil for the United States on Friday after refusing to concede defeat, rattled the cages of Brazil’s young democracy with baseless claims of electoral weaknesses that birthed a violent movement of election deniers.","Anthony Boadle, Gabriel Stargardter, REUTERS",2023-01-02

All around, sea and air merge into a uniform shade of blue. These are the Fari Islands, the apex of tropical perfection situated near the northern end of the archipelago that makes up the Maldives, one of the ultimate vacation destinations for the world’s wealthiest. Made up of 1,200 specks of land sprinkled over hundreds of miles of Indian Ocean, the Maldives are in fact a series of 55 million-year-old limestone outcroppings perched atop a submerged volcanic plateau. But these islands, and many others like them, are dying. They are on the front lines of a losing battle with global warming, one in which paradise has been transformed into a sun-drenched dystopia as whole nations face a watery obliteration. Indeed, the climate prognosis for the Maldives is bleak: According to NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey, by 2050 some 80% of the country could be uninhabitable. Even if the world’s nations suddenly pivoted away from fossil fuels, this country’s fate seems unavoidable.","Ross Urken, Bloomberg",2023-01-03

The number of ships sailing through this narrow strait, which connects Black Sea ports to wider waters, plummeted when Russia invaded Ukraine 10 months ago and imposed a naval blockade. Under diplomatic pressure, Moscow has begun allowing some vessels to pass, but it continues to restrict most shipments from Ukraine, which together with Russia once exported a quarter of the world’s wheat. And at the few Ukrainian ports that are operational, Russia’s missile and drone attacks on Ukraine’s energy grid periodically cripple the grain terminals where wheat and corn are loaded onto ships.","Edward Wong, Ana Swanson, The New York Times",2023-01-03

Despite its razor thin majorities, the 2021-23 Democratic-controlled Congress was one of the most productive in modern history, writing all manner of legislation — much of it bipartisan — on manufacturing, infrastructure, gun control, the climate crisis and more.

Most of the so-called rare earth elements are mined in China. Russian Railways JSC and other carriers are hauling a rising volume of critical metals needed for Europe’s defense industry. The volume of Chinese rare earth metals shipped on trains across Russia surged to 36,074 tons in the first nine months last year, more than double the amount transported in all of 2021, according to European Union data seen by Bloomberg News. The value of that trade rose by more than fourth-fifths, to €377 million ($408 million) through September.","Jonathan Tirone, Alberto Nardelli, Bloomberg, Reuters",2023-01-23

The Kremlin aims to demonstrate that its forces can regain the initiative after months of losing ground, putting pressure on Kyiv and its backers to agree to some kind of truce that leaves Russia in control of the territory it now occupies, according to officials, advisers and others familiar with the situation. Even Putin can’t deny the weaknesses of the military that he’s spent decades building up after his troops lost more than half their initial gains in Ukraine, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss matters that aren’t public. The persistent setbacks have led many in the Kremlin to more realistic about their immediate ambitions, recognizing that even holding the current front line would be an achievement.",BLOOMBERG,2023-01-30

But for Islamabad, the outflows are exacerbating a rapidly developing economic crisis. Traders and smugglers are bringing as much as $5 million across the border daily, according to Muhammad Zafar Paracha, general secretary of the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan, a 26-member body of currency dealers. That more than covers the as much as $17 million that Afghanistan’s central bank injects into the market each week. The illicit flows show how the Taliban are evading sanctions after their 2021 takeover of the country. For Pakistan, it’s contributing to the depletion of foreign reserves and adding to the downward pressure on the rupee as the currency tumbles to record lows and the economy teeters on the edge of collapse.","Eltaf Najafizada, Ismail Dilawar, Bloomberg",2023-02-07

Wetlands provide critical and historically under-recognized benefits to humanity, including flood defense, water storage and biodiversity protection, but their conversion for other uses has often proved more attractive in the short term than sustaining them. The issue of wetland destruction has come into focus in recent months amid global efforts to halt a catastrophic loss of species-rich ecosystems. Almost 200 countries agreed at the United Nations COP15 summit in Montreal in December to an ambitious and urgent program to halt biodiversity loss.The findings of the large-scale study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, are substantially lower than previous estimates, some of which were based on extrapolating from regional wetland loss.

That realization was fundamental to almost every discussion at the annual Munich Security Conference where senior officials from the trans-Atlantic defense community grappled with how to meet the vastly increased demand for ammunition and weapons that such a war implies. They also wrestled with how to enforce economic sanctions against Moscow, how to persuade the global south to embrace Ukraine’s cause, and what role China will decide to play in the war.","Marc Champion, Bloomberg",2023-02-20

But it was also the first of several direct challenges on this trip to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who a year ago this week believed the Ukrainian capital would become Russian-controlled territory again in a matter of days, moving Putin closer to his ambition of restoring the empire of Peter the Great. “Putin’s war of conquest is failing,” Biden declared from the palace, his very presence there, alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, meant to symbolize Russia’s failure to take a capital that today remains brimming with life, its restaurants overflowing even as warning sirens blare.","David E.

The search for a downed UFO began and ended near this oil-camp town at the frozen edge of the world, where Navy pilots flying P-8 Poseidons finally gave up on Friday, ending their mission with no answers. Hours later and about 500 miles away, Canadian forces searching for the shreds of a second object in the Yukon Territory retreated empty-handed. The same thing happened on Lake Huron, where Coast Guard captains docked their boats without finding whatever it was that F-22 fighter pilots shot out of the sky with a $400,000 Sidewinder missile.

The high seas — areas lying beyond countries' exclusive economic zones — make up nearly two-thirds of the world's oceans, which means a global agreement is needed on how to preserve and manage the waters and their biodiversity.

But , which took it to an extreme, has cast doubts over the approach and left a gaping hole in the world’s game plan for the next pandemic. Even outside China, elimination measures such as stay-at-home orders proved politically unpopular and difficult to carry out. With some medical experts doubting whether airborne respiratory pathogens can be suppressed, global public health officials are now without a consensus on how best to contain new infectious diseases. Early in the pandemic, proponents argued the strategy was morally, scientifically and economically superior to so-called mitigation approaches, such as slowing the spread of disease through physical distancing and limiting social gatherings or letting the virus loose among the young while protecting more vulnerable members of the population.","Michelle Fay Cortez, Bloomberg",2023-02-21

The actual center of the Earth is nothing like this fanciful depiction — but in some ways, it is even more dramatic. Researchers on Tuesday said an intensive study of Earth’s deep interior, based on the behavior of seismic waves from large earthquakes, confirmed the existence of a distinct structure inside our planet’s inner core — a wickedly hot innermost solid ball of iron and nickel about 1,350 kilometers wide. Earth’s diameter is about 12,750 kilometers. The planet’s internal structure comprises four layers: a rocky crust on the outside, then a rocky mantle, an outer core made of magma and a solid inner core. This metallic inner core, about 2,440 km wide, was discovered in the 1930s, also based on seismic waves traveling through Earth.","Will Dunham, Reuters",2023-02-22

35,How Europe ditched Russian fossil fuels with spectacular speed,"Europe’s most remarkable response to Russia’s war on Ukraine hasn’t been marshaling military equipment and billions of euros in aid. It’s been the unprecedented speed of an energy transition that in one year has nearly eliminated its dependence on Russian fossil fuels in an attempt to strangle the key source of funding for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war machine. The shift has been far from the kind of climate-first transition that Europe has envisioned for its long-term future, with governments paying whatever it takes to secure liquefied sources of natural gas brought in by ships, burning more coal and ripping up some environmental plans in the process. And it’s been painful, with Europe getting hit by a roughly $1 trillion energy bill last year, cushioned by hundreds of billions of euros of government subsidies. Still, even the most optimistic outlooks from analysts and the bloc’s own leaders at the outset of the war failed to predict how quickly Europe could move. A year ago, Europe spent about $1 billion a day to pay for gas, oil, and coal imported from Russia. Today, it pays a small fraction of that amount.","Will Mathis, Akshat Rathi, Bloomberg",2023-02-23

37,Bone study transforms understanding of dinosaur growth,"The dinosaur group called theropods included the largest land meat-eaters ever to roam the Earth — up to the size of a school bus. But there also were theropods the size of a tabby cat and others of various dimensions, including beaked and toothless fruit-eaters and some bizarre long-clawed species that redefine weird. Scientists had long believed that these dinosaurs followed a uniform pattern in determining the body size of a species, whether gigantic or diminutive, with the rate of growth being the deciding factor — faster meaning bigger and slower meaning smaller. A new study adds to the evidence overturning that idea. Researchers said on Thursday they examined rings called cortical growth marks laid down annually inside the bones as these animals grew — akin to growth rings inside tree trunks — of three dozen theropod species. Widely spaced rings indicate a speedier growth rate. Closely spaced rings indicate slower growth.","Will Dunham, REUTERS",2023-02-24

29,How Biden’s shock-and-awe tactic is failing to stop Russia,"National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan’s West Wing office was crammed with sleep-deprived staffers on the morning of Feb. 26, 2022. Clad in jeans and button-down shirts, clutching coffees or cold pizza, they were waiting for U.S. President Joe Biden to join on a secure line. Russia had invaded Ukraine two days earlier. The burning question of the day: How to stop a war. The U.S. had been warning of a looming invasion for weeks. Sullivan’s team had a plan, one they’d kept closely held out of fear it would be discovered by Russian intelligence. It involved freezing some $300 billion of Russian central bank assets held abroad. That would generate enough shock and awe, the authors figured, to bring Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war to a halt — or at the very least, severely hamper his ability to fight it. The measure, seen at the time as the economic equivalent of a nuclear weapon, was announced at 5 p.m. in Washington that Saturday. In the days that followed, as Russia’s currency tanked, prices soared, and people lined up at banks to pull out whatever cash they could, some Biden aides briefly worried that they’d gone too far. They didn’t want to completely crater the Russian economy, out of fear the damage would spread to Europe and beyond.","Daniel Flatley, Bloomberg",2023-02-24

21,CPR and defibrillators: What you need to know,"Before 1958, there was no such thing as CPR. If someone’s heart stopped because of cardiac arrest, that person fell to the ground, with no pulse, no breathing. And they were simply declared dead. All of that changed when doctors at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore discovered cardiopulmonary resuscitation by accident when studying how to shock a heart. When they pressed defibrillator panels to the chest of a lab dog, they saw a blip in blood pressure. They pressed harder and discovered they could push blood through the body. And thus was born CPR. The problem is that only a tiny fraction of people who experience cardiac arrest and are not at a hospital get CPR. That, said Dr. Benjamin Abella, medical director of the Center for Resuscitation Science at the University of Pennsylvania, is “a national tragedy.” Bystander CPR can be the difference between life and death, as the case of Damar Hamlin demonstrated during a Buffalo Bills-Cincinnati Bengals football game in January.","Gina Kolata, The New York Times",2023-02-25

7,War in Ukraine deepens divide among major economies at G20 gathering,"A year after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the war is deepening the division among the world’s major economies, threatening fragile recoveries by disrupting food and energy supply chains and distracting from plans to combat poverty and restructure debt in poor countries. Those fissures were evident this past week as top economic policymakers from the Group of 20 nations gathered for two days at a resort in Bengaluru, a city in southern India, where efforts to demonstrate unity were overshadowed by flaring tensions over Russia. During the summit, Western nations imposed a barrage of new sanctions on Moscow and unveiled more economic support for Ukraine, while developing countries like India, which have been reaping the benefits of cheap Russian oil, resisted expressing criticism. The differing views left officials struggling to cobble together the traditional joint statement, or communique, on Saturday, forcing senior representatives from the Group of Seven nations, the world’s most advanced economies, to try to convince reluctant counterparts that defending Ukraine was worth the cost.","Alan Rappeport, The New York Times",2023-02-26
14,"Their hair long and flowing or in ponytails, women in Iran flaunt their locks","An engineer strode onstage at an event in Tehran, Iran, wearing tight pants and a stylish shirt, and clutching a microphone in one hand. Her long brown hair, tied in a ponytail, swung freely behind her, uncovered, in open defiance of Iran’s strict hijab law. “I am Zeinab Kazempour,” she told the convention of Iran’s professional association of engineers. She condemned the group for supporting the hijab rules, and then she marched offstage, removing a scarf from around her neck and tossing it to the floor under a giant image of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The packed auditorium erupted in cheers, claps and whistles. A video of Kazempour went viral on social media and local news sites, making her the latest champion for many Iranians in a growing, open challenge to the hijab law.","Farnaz Fassihi, The New York Times",2023-02-26
8,"Tempered in a crucible of violence, Zelenskyy rises to the moment","As Russian tanks rumbled into Ukraine in the predawn a year ago, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recorded a simple video address to his nation: ""We are strong,” he said. ""We will defeat everyone because we are Ukraine.” Amid the swirl of chaotic battles, shifting military fortunes and the thorny terrain of global diplomacy that followed, one thing remained constant: Zelenskyy showing up in selfies filmed on his phone, to deliver speeches and to appear in slickly produced videos beamed into foreign parliaments, his haggard, bearded but defiant appearance becoming the face of Ukraine’s struggle at home and abroad. For years, Zelenskyy, a former comedic actor, had been brushed off by critics as a lightweight, new to politics, naive about Russia and buffeted by the political headwinds of a presidential impeachment in the United States and a failed diplomatic endeavor with Russia. That is no longer the case.","Andrew E. Kramer, KYIV",2023-02-26

But we are obviously in a position where we are on the cusp of a deal.” Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said he’s determined to get a deal done, but wouldn’t sign on to a plan that doesn’t resolve lingering problems from the original Brexit deal.",Bloomberg,2023-02-26

6,Islamist militants have Pakistan's police in their crosshairs,"Atop a police outpost in northwest Pakistan, Faizanullah Khan stands behind a stack of sandbags and peers through the sight of an anti-aircraft gun, scanning the terrain along the unofficial boundary with the country’s restive former tribal areas. On this cold and rainy February morning, he was looking not for aircraft but for Islamist fighters behind attacks against his force, the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa provincial police. It was daytime, so he could relax a bit, said Khan, an assistant sub-inspector, as he sat down on a traditional woven bed. But night was a different story, he said, pointing to pock marks left by bullets fired at the outpost, named Manzoor Shaheed, or Manzoor the Martyr, after a colleague felled by insurgents years ago.","Gibran Naiyyar Peshimam, Jibran Ahmad, REUTERS",2023-02-27
11,Sunak set to unveil Northern Ireland Brexit deal with EU,"Rishi Sunak and Ursula von der Leyen will meet in the U.K. on Monday in the early afternoon for final talks ahead of an expected announcement of a post-Brexit settlement for Northern Ireland. The meeting in Berkshire, where King Charles II’s Windsor Castle is situated, suggests the U.K. and the European Union are finally ready to settle their differences over a standoff that has persisted since the U.K.’s departure from the EU single market and customs union in 2021. Finalizing Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit trading arrangements has been a hangover from the withdrawal agreement that the U.K. and the EU agreed in 2019, when Boris Johnson was Britain’s prime minister. Announcing a deal would be a triumph for Sunak, who has sought to dial down tensions with the EU since taking power in October. But there could still be peril ahead for the premier, who was unable to convince unionists in Northern Ireland and Brexiteers in his own ruling Conservative Party to endorse an agreement last week.","Kitty Donaldson, Ellen Milligan, Alberto Nardelli, Bloomberg",2023-02-27

And while they have seen no sign Beijing has done so yet, they underscored the U.S. message this weekend that China should not cross that red line.

16,"Lab leak most likely caused pandemic, U.S. Energy Department says","New intelligence has prompted the Energy Department to conclude that an accidental laboratory leak in China most likely caused the coronavirus pandemic, although U.S. spy agencies remain divided over the origins of the virus, U.S. officials said Sunday. The conclusion was a change from the department’s earlier position that it was undecided on how the virus emerged. Some officials briefed on the intelligence said that it was relatively weak and that the Energy Department’s conclusion was made with “low confidence,” suggesting its level of certainty was not high. While the department shared the information with other agencies, none of them changed their conclusions, officials said.","Julian E. Barnes, THE NEW YORK TIMES",2023-02-27

The vessel, which sailed from Turkey and was carrying people from Afghanistan, Iran and several other countries, sank in rough seas before dawn near Steccato di Cutro, a seaside resort on the eastern coast of Calabria. The incident has reopened a debate on migration in Europe and Italy, where the recently-elected right-wing government’s tough new laws for migrant rescue charities have drawn criticism from the United Nations and others.","Gianni Daniele, Alvise Armellini, REUTERS",2023-02-27
5,Sunak strikes post-Brexit Northern Ireland deal with EU,"British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak struck a deal with the European Union on post-Brexit trade rules for Northern Ireland on Monday, saying it would pave the way for a new chapter in London’s relationship with the bloc. Standing alongside European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at a news conference in Windsor, Sunak said the two sides had agreed to remove “any sense of a border” between Britain and its province — a situation that had angered politicians on both sides. He immediately won plaudits from business groups who welcomed the easing of trade rules, and an EU promise that it would be willing to allow British scientists to join its vast research program if Sunak’s party accepts the deal.","Elizabeth Piper, Sachin Ravikumar, REUTERS",2023-02-28

For months, the White House has been teasing an announcement that Biden will run again in 2024. Also for months, the White House has refused to confirm that he will. The latest strong hint that Biden is ready for lift off — yet as usual leaving wiggle room — came from First Lady Jill Biden in a series of interviews with U.S. media during a visit to Namibia and Kenya last week.","Sebastian Smith, AFP-Jiji",2023-02-28

Yellen met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Finance Minister Serhiy Marchenko and other key government officials just days into the war’s second year, repeating U.S. assurances delivered by President Joe Biden a week ago in Kyiv. “America will stand with Ukraine as long as it takes,” Yellen, flanked by sandbags at the cabinet ministers’ office, told Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, in a trip also aimed at shoring up support at home for continued aid.","Rod Nickel, REUTERS",2023-02-28
1,Brexit deal gives Sunak one chance to end years of EU acrimony,"British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s government is beginning its hardest sell: convincing skeptical Northern Irish politicians to back its new post-Brexit deal on trade with the European Union. That means one final effort before the U.K. can finally repair relations with its biggest trading partner. Monday’s unveiling of the Windsor Framework featured a confident Sunak and a smiling, enthusiastic European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The next, crucial stage of the process will be a game of detail, numbers and political arm-twisting. Sunak’s team now needs to win over a tiny caucus of Northern Ireland’s unionist politicians and an influential group of pro-Brexit MPs from his own Conservative Party. Failure could mean a need to push the deal through with support from the opposition Labour Party — a move that could be politically damaging for Sunak.","Ellen Milligan, Alex Wickham, Bloomberg",2023-02-28
0,The EU is cracking down on plastic. Will others follow?,"When U.N. negotiations over a global agreement on plastic waste convene for a second session this spring, the European Union will bring evidence that it practices what it preaches. In November, the European Commission proposed sweeping packaging regulations that would require companies selling products in EU countries to make their packaging easier to reuse, recycle or in some cases, compost. Takeaway food, hot and cold drinks, wine and other alcohol would have to be provided at least partly in reusable packaging by 2030, and the rules would limit unnecessary empty space in packaging. The EU’s overall goal: to reduce packaging waste by 5% by 2030, compared to 2018 levels, and by 15% by 2040. Many of these policies can also be found in proposals submitted by the EU ahead of the May U.N. session on plastic waste: minimums on recycled content and reusable packaging, limits on the use of labels claiming biodegradability, and “eco-design” criteria that includes avoiding empty space and promoting durable and refillable packaging. Those objectives also largely reflect the views of the U.N. negotiations’ “High Ambition Coalition,” a group of countries including EU member states and the U.K., Ghana, Senegal, Australia and Canada. The small island states most negatively impacted by marine plastic waste are also calling for better design and reuse.","Olivia Rudgard, Bloomberg",2023-02-28
